          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>If you've come to this guide you're either new to F1 2010 or like I was, not happy with the how your car corners.  I've played with a number of settings in car setup to get my cornering right, and try and dial out understeer.  If your F1 car is handling like a sedan, your first point of call would normally be car setup. Inappropriate controller setup can also braking and accelation problems and for those with a lack of fine motor control, adjusting pedal sensitivity may help.  You can adjust a number of settings for your wheel, both in and out of game.</p>
<p>This guide is based on probably the most popular controller in the competition, the Logitech G7, a decent device for the price and with 900 degrees of rotation.</p>
<p>900 Degrees of rotation is way too much for a Formula 1 car.  Drivers will have to cross their arms to turn full circle.  A more appropriate amount is between 180 and 200.  This is set in the Logitech Profiler. Remember to tick "Allow Game to Adjust Settings".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a number of In-Game settings that can be set, found in the Advanced options for your wheel.  </p>
<p> </p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of rotation where steering is ignored.  The higher this value the more you can more your wheel without it moving your car</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Saturation</strong></td>
<td>How quickly your wheel responds to your movements</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>The amount of turn of your wheel compared to the amount of wheel turn in game. 50% is a 1:1 mapping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of throttle that is ignored. The higher this value the more you can press on the throttle pedal without applying throttle in game</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the throttle pedal. Set to a lower value to reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you like to push your throttle down a long way when exiting corners, as a lower sensitivity will reduce wheelspin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of brake that is ignored. The higher this value the more you can press on the brake pedal without applying the brake in game</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the brake pedal. Set to a lower value to reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you're applying too much brake and frequently locking</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>If you feel your car setup is good but you still can't drive as smoothly as you'd like, have a play with various values for the above.  I personally am leadfooted (some say I have too much muscle, or perhaps I just need firmer pedals).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My settings are as follows (this provides a very twitchy and direct car, so may not be suited to everyone: </p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Saturation</strong></td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>Following changing to those settings from the more accepted defaults of 0% and 100% for Deadzone and Saturation and 50% for linearity, I believe my car is handling more like I want it to.</p>
<p>Another important setting is in the Force Feedback section.  Where you can the level of Force Feedback and wheel weight.  It is important to set the wheel weight a value <strong>lower</strong> than the Force Feedback.  Otherwise you won't get the sensation of the steering getter lighter as the front wheels lose grip.  That is you won't be able to detect when you're about to lose control.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered how the cars stack up against each other?  Most F1 fans know pretty which car is faster than another.  The game even gets the order pretty much when it comes to the car selection screens in Time Trial and Grand Prix.</p>
<p>I've conducted my own experiment and taken each car to <a href="/{localLink:1247}" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> (Time Trial) for a performance shootout.  To keep everything consistent and 'scientificy', I've used the same setup in each car.  Ok, so it's possible each car would have performed better relative to others with a car setup to suit, but I needed to eliminate all but one variable, the car.   Shanghai also has really challenging first few turns which I figure can tell a lot about a cars balance (it did).</p>
<p>I didn't pay too much attention to how each car 'felt', but some cars were different enough for me to really notice, and I've taken note.</p>
<p>I don't need to ramble on, so without further ado, here's the list ordered from fastest to slowest:</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I ran the Lotus first, as it's my current season 1 car, so I may have got faster as I got more track time.  I generally ran about 5 laps each car, or until I was pretty happy I wasn't going to go much faster. </p>
<p>The HRT was immediately faster than the Lotus, first lap.  The Toro Rosso was the same deal. First lap in the car and I laid it's time down.  I tried another few more laps thinking I could get more pace, as it did feel alot faster than the other three.</p>
<p>I tried for a good 8 to 10 laps on the Sauber, thinking it should be faster than the Toro Rosso but I just couldn't get it to my liking. </p>
<p>My first impression of the Williams was that is fast.  I got in it and half way round the first lap I was thinking "this is going to be good". </p>
<p>The Force India was actually rather fast and I tried for a good 10 laps to beat its time with the Renault.  In the end I gave up.  The Renault just couldn't get settled on the hairpin at the end of the straight, and the first corner. </p>
<p>The Mercedes, what do I say?  I hate this car. The nose is far too high and I couldn't see the brake markers or the edge of the track. I kept running off the track, or running too much kerb and slowing down.  It did eventually prove fastest at the time though, and felt fast too. </p>
<p>Getting in the Ferrari was like getting a different race category.  It felt so much better through turns one and two. I did keep spining it on the hairpin though.</p>
<p>Red Bull. One thoughy came to my mind when I took this car out.  <strong>Traction</strong>.  This car had it in spades and damn it got through turn 1 and 2 fast.  I loved it.</p>
<p>What can I say about the best team in the world ever.  No I'm not biaised. Not even a bit.  Last up was the Mclaren, my usual car in the atomic champ and the car I play the most, so perhaps that had some impact on my times.  It hammered through turns one and two and powered past the red bull on my first lap.  I smashed it through turn 6, braking later than the Red Bull and stopping easier.  More traction down and I was edging away from the RB through T7, though the RB clawed some back at T8, which I ran wide on each time in the macca.  And it stops so well.  Turn 14, the hairpin was much easier and from there it was an easy winner.  I think there's more pace in it too, but I wanted to get this guide written tonight :)</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>F1 2010 car setups are variable. The ranges you have to play with are determined by the track you are on.  This means two main points.  It's probably perfectly acceptable to run the same setup on nearly every track, as while the values on screen stay the same, their real world values change to suit the track, thus it's more like having the setup reflect an overall driving style.  The other point is that it's confusing to people who are well versed with car setup in other games and real life, where setup is not track dependant. They run the risk of setting small differences which have no effect in the game.  For example a front wing value of 1 does not produce the same downforce at Monza as it does at Monaco.  I made this mistake initially in my setup.  I went out with small differences between ride height and front and rear wings, thinking I don't want to go to big or the car would be too biased in one direction, only to find the setup changes of a few notches of front wing made no discernable difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5433/aerodynamics.png" width="250" height="125" alt="aerodynamics.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Aerodynamics</strong><br />Aero is king in Formula One.  A cars lap speed is mostly influenced by it's aerodynamic setup.  There are three main components to aerodynamics on a Formula One car and the game only makes two obvious.  Front and Rear wing settings can be found on the Aerodynamics page of car setup and these values control the amount of downforce generated at the front and rear of the car.</p>
<p>Wings should be the first and most important thing tweaked on a car setup.  It's easiest to think about wings like this: Front wing determines how fast you can go round corners; how much understeer your car generates.  Rear wing determines how fast you can go down the straight as well as how much oversteer you get during cornering.  Wing settings also influence braking distance.  A higher wing setting means the car is more stable under brakes and will stop faster.</p>
<p>Formula 1 cars also use the undertray (bottom) of the car to generate downforce, by channelling airflow through particular points. For this to work effectively, the car needs to be the right distance from the ground.  A general rule is the lower the car can run, the faster it will go. Think of it like the lower a car is to the ground, the easier it is for the car to be sucked to the road.</p>
<p>Ride height needs to be traded off against bumps in the road and spring (suspension) settings.  More on this in the suspension section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5451/braking.png" width="250" height="124" alt="braking.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Braking</strong><br />Brake balance influences stopping distance and how your car enters a corner (especially when trail braking).  As a cars brakes are applied, the weight of the car moves forward, thus in general front biased brake balance should help a car stop quicker.  On a road car this is managed by putting larger brake discs on the front than back.  Brake balance can also play a part in when and how often your wheels lock during braking.  Locking wheels are bad.  When wheels are locked, they're sliding over the top of the road and are no longer slowing the car down (as they're sliding, they're not griping the road).  Locked wheels also cause flat-spots, which make the tyre resemble a 50 cent piece and make the car harder to drive.  An approach I take to setting brake balance is to first determine the corner where braking is most critical to lap time and then set my brakes up to work best for that corner.</p>
<p>Brake pressure effects how easily your brakes lock.  A higher pressure will make it easier to lock the brakes but it will also make the car stop faster. It's a trade-off and depends on brake balance also.</p>
<p>Brake size determines how long your brakes work effectively during the race.  On high force braking tracks like Canada and Monza, large brakes will mean you'll have more effective brakes at the end of the race. The trade-off is more size = more weight, so your car will be heavier and slightly slower.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5445/balance.png" width="250" height="126" alt="balance.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Balance</strong><br />Ballast is lumps of weight that are placed at strategic positions on the car to set it's braking, accelerating and cornering attitude<strong>.  </strong>In real F1 the cars must be a minimum weight, so ballast is used to bring the car up to minimum as well as to aide in balance. Drivers like Mark Webber, who are considerable (10-15 and more kg's) heavier than others like Massa, Vettel, and Heidfeld have less ballast to play with.</p>
<p>Essentially more weight over the front improves front grip and more weight over the rear improves rear grip.  Ballast is a weight, a downward force, like downforce (see the <a href="/guides/what-is-grip-and-how-is-it-managed-in-f1-2010/">guide on grip</a> for more).  Fast high speed corners require more front end grip to reduce understeer, so I like to assign more front ballast bias in this case.  Where you're accelerating hard out of low speed tight corners, a more rear bias grip may prove beneficial in getting traction as well as preventing snap oversteer on entry (brake balance can help there too).</p>
<p>ARBs, or anti-roll bars reduce the amount of lateral roll through corners.  The higher the value, the lower body roll.  It is also used to control levels of understeer and oversteer.  A bias toward the front tends the car to understeer and bias toward rear will tend the car towards oversteer.  Configuring the ARBs to be too stiff all round will cause the inside wheels to lift off the ground when cornering and this will reduce traction.</p>
<p>ARB's also work in tandem with springs (see below) to stiff the car, so spring settings must also be considered when ARB's are adjusted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5469/suspension.png" width="250" height="126" alt="suspension.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Suspension</strong><br />As mention in the aerodynamics section, ride height determines the amount of downforce generated by the undertray of the car and comprises as much as 40% of the total downforce of an F1 car.  That's too huge a number to be ignored.  Ride height also affects the ability of the car to ride kerbs or bumps in the track.  Too low a ride height will cause the car to bottom out over bumps.  Once a car bottoms out the downforce generated by the undertray becomes zero (as effectively the airflow is cut and stalled).<strong>  </strong></p>
<p>Ride height can also be used to help influence car balance by way of weight transfer.  This is performed by raising one end of the car higher than the other, pushing the centre of gravity either forward or back.  As with ballast, a raised front will shift weight rearward and reduce front end grip, tending the car to understeer, while a relative raised rear will help cure understeer and tend the car to oversteer.</p>
<p>Springs have a few functions.  A soft setting allows the tyre to maintain contact with the road over bumps, providing more traction and grip.  Soft springs also mean you have to run a higher ride height.  Downforce increases exponentially with speed, so the faster you go the more downforce you generate.  Downforce pushes the car down effect ride height.  Thus if you run soft springs on a fast circuit you run the risk of bottoming out on fast corners and losing control.  Springs also effect body roll (as mentioned in balance and anti-roll bars) and help tune understeer/oversteer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5463/gearbox.png" width="250" height="125" alt="gearbox.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Gearbox</strong><br />The typical recommendation is to select the 1st gear ratio that will propel you off the line the fastest and select the 7th gear ration that will cause your engine to hit the rev limit just before the braking point of the fastest part of the circuit.</p>
<p>But what do you do in between?  You can either space the gears evenly from 1st through to 7th or you can bias low gearing and have a long 7th gear, or vice-versus. </p>
<p>F1 2010 is confusing in that I would expect if you set all the gear markers in a line, you would be at the same speed in all gears (have the same ratio/number of teeth).  However that's not the case.   You can clearly see that all in a line (the default) results in different top speeds in each gear. </p>
<p>Also think about traction when you consider gear ratios. A higher ratio will result on more traction but not accelerate as hard. What this means it that in some corners it's better to have more traction than wheel spin, so the end result is greater acceleration; while in others, wheel-spin doesn't come into it, so purely a lower gear ratio is better.</p>
<p>My preference is to set the car up with a high 1st gear, giving my good traction and a much lower 2nd through 6th gear, very closely spaced.  My 7th gear is generally high, so I get good top end speed and good acceleration through the corners.  The only downside is I'm susceptible to overtakes when I'm in 7th gear a pulling low revs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5439/alignment.png" width="250" height="126" alt="alignment.png" style="float: left;"/><br /><strong>Alignment</strong><br />Camber refers to the angle your wheels make with the ground.  A highly camber tyre means the tyre leans either in or out from the car.  F1 2010 does negative cambers only (a sensible idea) which means the tyre leans in toward the car at the top.  A larger negative camber increases the ability to turn the car (reduces oversteer).  This is because when the cornering forces are exerted on the tyre, the tyre deforms and more contact patch is on the road, offering up more grip.</p>
<p>The flipside of negative camber is that when you accelerate in a straight line you have less tyre on the road and therefore less grip and either can't accelerate as hard or get snap oversteer on corner exit. </p>
<p>A high speed track like Monza would require little negative camber compared to a circuit like Monaco.</p>
<p>Toe operates on the other plane to Camber.  That is, Toe-in means the front of the tyre is closer to the vehicle than the rear of the tyre.  F1 2010 always deals with Toe-in.  More Toe-in causes more straight line stability at the cost of turn in response.</p>
<p>How does camber interact with toe?  When a wheel is cambered, the interaction between the tyre and the road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface.  This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance and tyre wear. A small amount of toe-out will counter the effect of negative camber on rolling resistance.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>You will not win, do not try to win. Your goal is to drive cleanly and not ruin anyone’s day.<br /><br />Enable the track view and watch it like a radar. If you see fast cars coming up to pass or lap you, give them plenty of room.  Most likely they're having a battle of their own and it's extremely bad form to ruin the race a car lapping you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/481/go-kart.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="go-kart.jpg" style="float: right;"/></p>
<p><strong>How to let cars past:</strong><br />Stay off the racing line, go slow, do not suddenly change ‘lanes’ or lines right when the other car is upon you. Be aware that you may be lapped/passed by a group of cars in quick sucession – watch the radar. An approaching driver will usually let you know when he's about to pass you, slow down and pull off the racing line.<br /><br />Map a wheel button to rear view and get used to doing snap views to check often.<br /><br /><strong>Rejoining after an off</strong><br />Please be very careful, be aware of where other cars are and wait even if it means waiting til they pass and losing position. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Qualifying</strong><br />Qualifying is short, and with many cars on the track, a driver may often have just one or two clean laps to put in a time. <br /><br />• If you’ve come off at some point or generally are doing a lap that won’t improve your grid position – take it easy when you see other cars. Let them past, and stay off the racing line as you do so.<br /><br />• If you are on a hot lap and coming up on someone going slowly you may want to warn them you’re coming through on a hot one. You may wish to say something cool like "Blazer blazer blazer - I am hot, repeat, I am hot".<br /><br />• Maintain distance. Never tail anyone or roadblock traffic. Qualy is not a race or a time to compare your pace or cornering line to others. Maintain at least 200-300 meters between cars ahead and behind. More is better.<br /><br /><strong>The start</strong><br />Unlike every vs AI race you’ve ever driven – races ARE NOT won on the first corner. Your only goal is to:<br /><br />1. Not touch anyone.<br />2. Not impede anyone.<br />3. Not brake too early, too late, too softly or too hard.<br /><br /><em>Remember that:</em><br />1. Your tires and brakes are cold, you will have no grip.<br />2. The normal braking marker for turn 1 that you carefully memorised and practised does not apply on a start, because of: above, and, because the run to turn 1 is shorter from the grid so your speed will be different. Practise race starts against AI to have some idea.<br />3. You are surrounded by other cars, most of which you cannot see and may be alongside you. Drive smoothly, predictably and conservatively.<br />4. If you fuck up at the start and cause grief for anyone/everyone (most especially ruin a championship contender’s race) you will be vilified, abused, distrusted and looked down upon for many weeks. <br /><br /><strong>Microphone</strong><br />Make sure your mic is adjusted properly in the GFWL drop down settings. Talk to yourself while you adjust the two main levels (volume and sensitivity) so there's no distortion, and that the mic isn't triggered by ambient sounds like the sound of your speakers or breathing or the mic shuffling against your clothes. There is no need to shout.<br /><br /><strong>Misc.</strong><br />Please be on time. Race start is published well in advanced of the race and we don't and won't be wanting to wait around for a straggler to turn up.  If you are going to be late, please advise on the forums.<br /><br />Most of all, enjoy yourself. We’re all here to have fun.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/392/21_f109_Make_Cars_Green_Tyres_02.jpg" width="199" height="133" alt="21_f109_Make_Cars_Green_Tyres_02.jpg" style="float: right;"/></p>
<p>Simply put, Grip is the <em>tyre’s friction co-efficient x weight</em>. </p>
<p>There are two aspects to grip, <strong>Mechanical</strong> and <strong>Aerodynamic</strong>.  The mechanical aspect controls the left side of the above equation, the friction co-efficient of the tyre, while the weight is controlled by aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Aerodynamics are used to control downforce, which is a downward pressure on the car increasing its <strong>weight</strong> and thus it’s grip levels.</p>
<p>Mechanical Grip is optimised by ensuring the tyre is maintaining maximum contact with the road at all times.  This contact does not include slipping.  If you’re wheels are spinning, your tyres have broken contact with the ground, the <strong>friction co-efficient</strong> is basically 0 and no matter how much weight you have, you’re grip is nothing. </p>
<p>The easiest way to think about it is Mechanical Grip is controlled by what’s underneath the car, and Aerodynamic Grip is controlled by what’s on top, now that we don’t have ground-effect cars, and although the rear-diffuser is hugely important, it is not adjustable in F1 2011.  Mechanical grip is controlled by springs, anti-roll bars, and camber and caster.</p>
<p>Aerodynamic grip is all important at high speed tracks, tracks with fast sweeping turns and smooth surfaces, like Spa-francorchamps or Catalunya.  Mechincal Grip is king at slow tracks such as Monaco and also you to get better drive out of slow speed corners.  At a track like Monaco, Aerodynamic Grip is next to useless and at a track like Catalunya, Mechanical Grip plays a tiny part on lap pace.   Aerodynamic grip is controlled by the front and rear wings and the gap between the road and the bottom of the car, which also factors in the wing settings pushing the car down, the ride height and the spring stiffness.  Soft springs will mean make the aerodynamic downforce push the car down more than hard springs.  The correct ride height needs to take this into consideration.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><span><strong>Recording</strong><br />FRAPS is the utility of choice for recording all in game footage. I won't go into details of what other things it can do, but you can read all you want about it @ www.fraps.com<br /><br /><strong>A couple things about FRAPS before you start</strong><br />You will need to have the full version of FRAPS if you wish to record anything longer than a few minutes. The demo only allows a short recording time as well as putting a watermark on it. Make sure you get the full version. Once FRAPS is installed it will do two things. It will install both the utility program, and also FRAPS's own codec. Remember that if you record on one PC and try and play your FRAPS recordings on another it won't work. It must have also have FRAPS installed so it has the codec too, you can't install it separately.<br /><br /><strong>Setup</strong><br />When you load FRAPS you'll be greeted with the following screen.<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g287/Atomic_Lambo/FRAPS.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image"/><br />It's all pretty straight forward here, but a few notes to consider.<br /><br />1.) FRAPS records in an almost RAW format and as such is very HDD intensive. It's highly recommended not to use the same drive as either your installation drive where your game is installed, or where your swap file might be located. You don't need a super fast HDD (though it helps), but it's more important to have a separate HDD. This way it will help minimize frame rate loss from any HDD thrashing.<br /><br />2.) There is no option to select which resolution to record in. That is dictated by the game resolution. You have two options, Full-size, and Half-size. Full size will mean you record at the same res as your game but will have a bigger affect on your frame-rate. Half-size will record at half resolution. IE if your running a game at full 1600 x 1200, half resolution would be 800 x 600 recording. It will also have a smaller affect on frame rate loss. F1 2010 is pretty kind on the FPS, so don't be afraid to drop the resolution, and up the quality settings to find a happy medium between image quality and a resolution you can record at with minimum frame rate loss.<br /><br />Only other options to contend with is the sound capture settings. Make sure obviously that 'Record Win7 sound' is ticked. Otherwise FRAPS will record with no sound, this option is on by default. Another option you can decide on is the external Audio input. If you want FRAPS to record any microphone or alternative sounds that might be derived from something else other than the game audio then make sure you tick this. I choose not to as it can be distracting, but up to you. Lastly, capture settings, just leave it at 30FPS. Really no need to mess with this setting. Any other settings just leave as default.<br /><br /><strong>Recording</strong><br />Once in game it's just a case of hitting the 'Video Capture Hotkey' this is generally F9 or what ever button or key you binded it to. FRAPS will keep recording till you hit the capture key again. Once you've finished recording you will fine in your specified capture directory your Fraps recordings. While the full version of FRAPS allows you to record for as long as you want, it cannot do so in just one file. So one recording session will most likely will have multiple files. The biggest file size FRAPS will use is 4GB or (3.9GB give or take). Any given recording length will depend on what settings you use in game in regards to resolution, and what settings you used in FRAPS (Full-size or Half-Size), as well as any audio settings you may have added. Generally about 2 minutes of Half-size recording at 30FPS at full HD game resolution will result in about 4GB. As such for an entire race you will need around 20-25GB's so make sure you have plenty of room before you start. <br /><br /><strong>Encoding and cutting your video</strong><br />So you've recorded your race now it's time to cut it. There are billions of programs and utilities you can use to cut your video. If you want free, the most common one is probably Microsoft Movie Maker. This used to be included with windows but is now part of the Windows Live Essentials. You can download it here: <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker?os=other" target="_blank">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker?os=other</a><br />Personally I use Adobe Premiere Pro, which for all purposes is overkill but does give you complete control of everything.<br /><br />The way you cut your video is up to you, there is no point showing you how to do that because it will depend on what your using but I will give you these general tips.<br /><br />If your video is in 4:3/16:10/16:9 then create a video file that suits the aspect ratio. Don't encode a widescreen into 4:3 or vice versa. All you will get is a small screen with bars and your file will be unnecessarily big. Also remember that the resolution you use will affect how youtube perceives your video.<br /><br />You can encode your video in any number of formats. DivX, Xvid, h264 etc. Any of these are preferred because once your file is created it will be quite large. Personally I suggest h264. However if your using movie maker, I don't believe they offer much alternatives than the stanard AVI. You will probably then need an additional program or utility to encode your file. There are a number out there. If your using adobe premiere it will do this work for you. Otherwise there are products from Nero, Pinacle and free ones that will do the job.<br /><br />For youtube I don't recommend encoding your files larger than 350mb-400mb or else it takes quite a long time to upload. However if you have the speed and time you are free to go as large as 2GB, but I wouldn't advise that. Generally I encode two files. One at ultra high resolution for myself for viewing later, and smaller version that is suitable for youtube. If you do upload a HD version of your video, allow an extra 10 or 15 minutes by youtube to render it properly. If you play it immediately you might be convinced your video didn't upload properly. <br /></span></p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We all have two feet and the brake of a race car generally require the use of a foot: so which one is better and why?</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Left foot Trail Braking</li>
<li>Right foot Heel-Toe</li>
<li>Left foot increases entry speed</li>
<li>Right foot easier</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Racers having risen through the go-kart ranks and through open wheelers are typically more left foot brakers.  They use their right foot to accelarate and their left foot to brake.  This is made mandatory in karting where it's just not possible to get the right foot across to the brake, as you would in a road car.  It's also important when the vehicle you're driving is low powered, such as a go-kart, because it allows you more time on the thottle and you lose less revs.  Left foot braking also allows for trail braking, where you're applying both the brake and the accellerator.  The main problem with left foot braking in a high performance vehicle is the level of skill needed.  It's an advanced technique.  Most every driver is fimiliar with right foot braking, through their experience driving their day to day cars on public roads.  This makes right foot braking more natural and easier to regulate pressure and thus brake consistently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned, left foot braking allows trail braking, allowing a driver to apply the brakes while turning, decreasing the braking level as the corner speed decreases and corner angle increases.  This allows the driver to brake later than their right foot counterparts, and gain a few meters on corner entry. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Left foot braking also means there is no transition from brake to accelarator, where maybe up to half a second maybe lost at each corner.  This can make a big difference at tracks like <a href="/%7BlocalLink:1248%7D" title="Monaco">Monaco</a>, where there are many low speed corners.  You can also use a more advanced technique known as cadence braking, where the brakes are repitiively applied hard and then softer during the one braking maneouver, in an attempt to reduce the risk of a lock-up and decrease braking distances.  This technique is particularly successful in racing games.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Left foot braking can also be used to balance the car in high speed corners, still trail braking, but the purpose here is to lose maybe a 2-4 kph to prevent understeer or running off the track.  This is particular useful at tracks with high speed corners such as <a href="/%7BlocalLink:1255%7D" title="Spa Francorchamps">Spa-Francorchamps</a> or <a href="/%7BlocalLink:1252%7D" title="Silverstone">Silverstone</a>.  It's important to realise that a car is most stable when under power, so lifting off the accelerator to prevent an off-track moment may infact cause that moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The alternative to trail braking is "heel-toe", where as the name suggests, the driver uses his toe on the brake and his heel to "blip" the throttle.  In a clutchless world drivers don't really need to "heel-toe", as this was more brought about be ensuring the gear speed in gearboxes are sychronised during a change, and with the need to depress the clutch with the left foot braking had to be done with the right.  In an F1 car, right foot braking is only beneficial when your left foot memory msucle is hardcoded to the clutch pedal.  Most real life F1 drivers are staunch supports of left foot braking and simply cannot go as fast using the right foot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately left foot braking is an advanced technique and as a rookie, you may have more speed right foot braking, even if you don't need to use a clutch.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <thumbnail>1423</thumbnail>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>A racing circuit is comprised of left and right turns and straights that link up to form an unbroken 'loop'.  Pretty simple stuff really.  Each racing circuit is of varying length, with some tracks up to 22m wide at points, like Malaysia, and others are only 6m in points, like Monaco.</p>
<p>The fastest way to get from point A to point B is always going to be a straight line. Thus, the basic key is to keep the car as straight as possible as often as possible.  This typically, but not always, means finding the straightest line through a turn, or series of turns.</p>
<p>Also, remember that when the wheels aren't pointed straight ahead relative to the rest of the car, they're generating side forces instead of forward forces.  This means they're basically wasting energy and decreasing the life of the tyre as they slide laterally over the rod.</p>
<p>Now for some terminology.</p>
<p><strong>Braking point: </strong>This is the point where you apply the brakes and begin deccelarating for the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Turn in:</strong> This is where you start turning the wheel proper to get through the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Apex</strong>: This is the a very important component of a turn and is the point where the car reaches the inside of the turn and usually is right on the end of the track.</p>
<p><strong>Track out</strong>: is the exit of a turn and usually found on the outside edge of the track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/media/5304/racing-line-300x262.png" width="300" height="262" alt="racing-line-300x262.png"/></p>
<p>You'll notice the above diagram defines early and late apexes. The "standard" apex is the yellow line and is in between the other two apexes.  Typically you would use an early or late apex to attempt an overtake, or if it suits your particular style of being a late braker (late apex and sharper steering input, with a slower entry speed).  An early apex might also be employed if you're overtaking or like to brake early, minimise steering inputs and maintain a higher entry speed with lower mid corner and exit speed.  Where you overtake a car and the apex you employ to do so depends on where the car is. For example, you might overtake on the side by taking an earlier apex and "parking it" on the apex, making the other car effective slow more than they would.  This is effective if they havent' also take an early apex, as it ruins their line and exit speed.</p>
<p>Now you know the basics of cornering, the tricky part is stringing it all together.  At first, the best approach is to take the shortest line between two points that is the standard apex in the middle of the corner.  You also need to allow for change of direction (transitions) such as driving through the <strong>Esses</strong> at Suzuka.  In that case you may not want to go completely from side to side because you're going to be extendind the overall distance through the series of turns.</p>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the basic line, start thinking about your own prefferred driving style and how this effects your line and apex of a corner.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that many tracks have green bollards on the corners. These aren't there just to hit.  These are corner markers, used when the corner may be hard to spot.  A good example of this is at a newer track like Abu Dhabi.  Here the bollards are pretty much spot on the apex and you can aim your front inside wheel at them and just skim them as you drive through the corner.  Certainly if you're consistently missing apexes and the corner has a bollard, aim for the bollard.  It's what it is there for.</p>
<p>Finally I should mention braking.  Theoretically all braking should be done in the braking zone and when the car is still going straight, before turn-in.  Why? Again, think about what the tyre is doing.  If the tyres are pointed straight ahead, they can be used exclusively for slowing the car.  If you turn the wheel while braking, the tyre must both provide grip to slow the car and grip to turn the corner without coming off.  You also run the risk of pinching or locking a brake and causing the car to spin.  <strong>Trail braking</strong> can be used succesfully though.  This is when braking is applied while turning, before the apex.  Trail braking should be the gentlest of braking though.  If you stab the brakes while turning, all you'll do is unsettle car and cause under/oversteer.  Gentle application of the brakes while turning can help the car turn faster and hit your apex.  It will also allow you to start braking later, as you can stop braking much closer to the apex.  Generalyl trail braking requires left foot braking.  See <a href="/{localLink:1317}" title="Choosing a braking foot and how it will effect your car balance">here</a> for more detailed information on left foot braking.</p>
<p>One final note (I promise), now that I've mentioned trail braking:  <strong>The Apex</strong> is the answer to the question "When should I stop braking and start accellarating.  You should not accellarate before the apex or you run the risk of overstreet/understeer.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/17394/gears_300x241.jpg"  width="300"  height="241" alt="gears.PNG" style="float: right;"/></p>
<p>The old theory for gear ratio selection went something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the ratio for your top gear by aiming to hit the rev limiter when about to brake first the first corner immediately following the longest straight.</li>
<li>Pick the ratio for your first gear that will maximise your start line getaway.</li>
<li>Distribute your other gears evenly between first and seventh</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>There are however other factors to consider. Sebastian Vettel showed us at the recent 2011 Italian GP at Monza that top speed is less critical to success. The commentators made a point of expressing how Vettel had gone with a different set of gear ratios than traditionally would be selected, and than what the majority the other competitors selected.</p>
<p>First gear is important because positions are hard to come by and it’s easiest to make up positions when the cars are closest together. This is obviously at the start. To increase torque and reduce wheelspin a high first gear is desired. spacing 2nd through 6th evenly toward 7th isn’t the correct way to go though.</p>
<p>In most cases you can consider 1st gear as <em>the starting gear</em> and then ignore it altogether. Gear 2nd gear significantly lower than 1st, so that off the line there’s maximum torque, but once second gear is engaged, there’s maximum power and you’re in the upper rev range before quickly shifting to 3rd.</p>
<p>Gears should be selected based on the circuit and the ratios should be kept close together and correctly selected to leave the engine in the best power generating rev range. You can short shift where extra traction is required.</p>
<p>Ideally 1st and 7th should be two taller bookends either side of your ratios, with 2nd through 6th closely together. Having a much tighter gearbox should provide better corner speed and as Sebastian Vettel provide, a faster lap time.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>This guide details how to set up your wheel for Codemasters F1 2011<img src="/media/2821/g27.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="g27.jpg" style="float: right;"/>.  I've focussed on the Logitech G27 wheel, as it's the wheel I use and the wheel in use by most of the competitors in the atomic f1 league.</p>
<p>If your F1 car is handling like a sedan, your first point of call would normally be car setup. Inappropriate controller setup can also cause braking and accelation problems and for those with a lack of fine motor control, adjusting pedal sensitivity may help.  You can adjust a number of settings for your wheel, both in and out of game.</p>
<p>Using the full 900 degrees of rotation will not mean you have to to shuffle your hands through multiple turns of the wheel to make it round Casino at Monaco.</p>
<p>There are a number of In-Game settings that can be set, found in the Advanced options for your wheel.  </p>
<p> </p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="140"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of rotation where steering is ignored.  The higher this value the more you can more your wheel without it moving your car</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Saturation</strong></td>
<td>How quickly your wheel responds to your movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>The amount of turn of your wheel compared to the amount of wheel turn in game. 100% is a 1:1 mapping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of throttle that is ignored. The higher this value the more you can press on the throttle pedal without applying throttle in game</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the throttle pedal. Set to a lower value to reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you like to push your throttle down a long way when exiting corners, as a lower sensitivity will reduce wheelspin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>The percent of brake that is ignored. The higher this value the more you can press on the brake pedal without applying the brake in game</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>The sensitivity of the brake pedal. Set to a lower value to reduce sensitivity. Helpful if you're applying too much brake and frequently locking</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>If you feel your car setup is good but you still can't drive as smoothly as you'd like, have a play with various values for the above.  I personally am leadfooted (some say I have too much muscle, or perhaps I just need firmer pedals).</p>
<p>The settings I use for my Logitech G27 with 900 degrees of rotation are as follows:</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="180"><strong>Steering Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Saturation</strong></td>
<td>73%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steering Linearity</strong></td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Throttle Saturation</strong></td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Deadzone</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Brake Saturation</strong></td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>This gives an in game wheel that maps 1:1 with your actual steering wheel, so when you're turned 90 degrees left on your wheel, your in game wheel is turned 90's left.  Perfect.</p>
<p>A big change is the amount of Throttle and Brake saturation to use.  Using 100% will make the car far too sensistive to throttle and brake inputs.  For me 10% and 15% are good levels.  With 0% brake it's possible to mash the brake pedal to the floor and not lock the brakes.  This is unrealistic and raises concerns over whether or not the driver is gettng the maximum braking force.  My preference is to adjust the sensitivity such that the brakes will lock when the pedal is almost fully depressed.  I want to use a bit of skill in keeping from locking, as well as ensuring I'm getting maximum braking force.</p>
<p>Another important setting is in the Force Feedback section.  Where you can the level of Force Feedback and wheel weight.  It is important to set the wheel weight a value <strong>lower</strong> than the Force Feedback.  Otherwise you won't get the sensation of the steering getter lighter as the front wheels lose grip.  That is you won't be able to detect when you're about to lose control.</p>
<p>I've also experienced a problem where my wheel seems to lag.  It takes large movements of my wheel to move the in game wheel a small amount, then moving my wheel only a little more makes the game wheel turn much faster proportionately.  To fix this, ensure your <em>Override Input Devide Type </em>is set to <em>None</em> (and not <em>Steering Wheel</em>).</p>
<p>I've also found that how you click on "Start Game" determines what controller will be used.  If you select this with your keyboards Enter key, the game will use Keyboard as the input method.  To use your wheel, instead press your wheels Start button.  On the Logitech G27 this is the second rightmost red button above the gear stick, by default.  You can change the default start button using the method detailed <a href="http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3406367/solution_F1_2011_default_contr.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>I've taken this one step further and changed the default mappings for my G27, so I can use the buttons I want to use and still use choose 'Logitech G27' in game.  This is doubly useful because I've found that the game occasionally loses my mappings.  Doing the following will mean your custom settings will never again be lost.</p>
<p>Each device is mapped in a xml config file found in the <strong>actionmap</strong> folder where your game is installed.  Within that folder you should find a file matching your controller.  For the Logitech G27, this is called '<strong>G27 Racing Wheel.xml</strong>'.  Before you make any changes be sure to make a backup of this file.</p>
<p>Once you've got the file open in your favourite text editor, you'll see it's just a typical xml file, made up of <strong>Action</strong> elements and <strong>Axis</strong> child elements. The Axis elements are the mappings you want to modify.  You'll see a deviceName of <strong>04dc29b</strong>, that is your Logitech G27. The other will be <strong>Keyboard</strong>.  The button names are <strong>win_con_di_buttonX</strong> where X is the button minus -1 on your logitech profiler.  Eg Where the Logitech Profile says Button 1, this is win_con_di_button0, as the buttons are 0 based. </p>
<p>To modify the config file to suit personal tastes just go to the appropriate action and enter the desired button.  There are a number of actions you don't need to worry about but the main ones ( you may want to change) are:</p>
<div class="post">
<ul>
<li>Quick Menu Up</li>
<li>Quick Menu Down</li>
<li>Quick Menu Left</li>
<li>Quick Menu Right</li>
<li>Enable KERS</li>
<li>Enable DCS (should be DRS!)</li>
<li>Look Back</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>OSD Swipe (This is 'Car Status' on the right hand side of the screen)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After you've modifed those you may also want to create a custom profile in the Logitech Profile so you can create macro buttons to quickly perform menu selections while racing, such as changing fuel mixes and selecting tyres.  Being able to quickly change your fuel settings, multiple times per lap, is a help at the competitive end of multiplayer racing, where 10ths of a second per lap make a big difference over 30+ laps.</p>
<p>You can download my settings by clicking on the download button below. Inside the zip file is my modified G27 Racing Wheel.xml and the default file of the same name</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button" href="/media/28361/g27_racing_wheel.zip">Download</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've made the following changes</p>

<p>To utilise Macros in game I needed to change the quick menu keys to the arrow pad, from the dpad, and to <strong>set the profile to persistent in the Logitech Profiler</strong> (that bit is important!).  I've also created a few Macros in the logitech profiler (turn recording pauses on before recording the marco).  You can see which Macros go where in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="/media/28354/profiler.png" alt="Profiler"/></p>
<p><strong>Converse Fuel</strong>: Up, Up Down<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Normal Fuel</strong>: Up, Up, Right</p>
<p><strong>Rich Fuel</strong>: Up, Up, Up</p>
<p>For <strong>Tyre Selection</strong> I use a cycling command. You have to make the commands that will participate in the cycle first and then create the order to cycle.  Each press of the button will cycle to the next tyre option.</p>
<p><strong>Prime Tyres</strong>: Up, Right, Up</p>
<p><strong>Option Tyres</strong>: Up, Right, Right</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate Tyres</strong>: Up, Right, Down</p>
<p><strong>Wet Tyres</strong>: Up, Right, Left</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>This doucment specifies the rules, restrictions and operations of the AtomicF1 competition for Season 4, as developed in collaboration with the FIA respresentative, Ben Mansill, and the constructors and drivers competiting the competition.</p>
<p>All by participating in the Atomic F1 Season 4 competition, all participants have agreed to the terms of competition layed out within this document.</p>
<p>1. The Atomic F1 championship will award points for drivers and teams in accordance with the FIA F1 rules.</p>
<p>1.1 Points will be awarded for the top 10 drivers to finish the race.  First place will be awarded 25 points, second place 18 points, third place 15 points, fourth place 12 points, fifth place 10 points, sixth place 8 points, seventh place 6 points, eigth place 4 points, ninth place 2 points, tenth place 1 point.</p>
<p>1.2 In the event of a race being held with less than 10 drivers, all drivers shall be awarded points in accordance with the scheme described in section 1.3.</p>
<p>1.3 Drivers not finishing the race shall not be eligible for points.  If only 4 drivers are classified as running at the end of the race, only those four drivers shall receive points. </p>
<p>1.4 The game engine shall determine who has and has not finished the race, by denoting non finishers with DNF.</p>
<p>1.5 Drivers who are disqualified from the race are classified as non-finishers and under section 1.5 shall not be entitled to recieve points.  Disqualified drivers are denoted as DSQ</p>
<p>2. Penalties will be issued by the game engine in accordance with the FIA rules.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3. It has been agreed that no drivers shall use spring settings of 11 for front and back.  spring settings of 11 for either front OR back are permitted.  This holds until Codemasters has patched the issue with 11/11 springs.  Anyone found to be using 11/11 springs shall immediately forfeit their points and be disqualified from the championship and excluded from any and all future championship events.</span><br /><em>Clause 3 has been removed following the release of Path 2 for F1 2011 which fixed the springs bug.</em></p>
<p>4. Races are held on every Sunday at 2000 Sydney time.  It is the responsibility of each competitor to allow for any timezone differences including seasonal shifts such as caused by daylight savings.</p>
<p>4.1 Race start times and dates are published well in advance and it is the responsibility of each competitor to know when the race is being held.  The Atomic F1 website at www.atomicf1.com lists all upcoming races on the home page.</p>
<p>4.2 There shall be a minimal grace period before races start.  This period is generally accepted to be 15 minutes after the official race start time.  The race may start without registered competitors at this point.  Competitors should log in prior to the listed race start time for systems checks and to ensure their entry into the race event.</p>
<p>5.  Motorsport is dangerous.  It is expected that all drivers participate in a 'gentlemanly' spirit.  In accordance with the F1 FIA rules 'Racing room' shall be given. </p>
<p>5.1 Drivers shall not move off their line in the braking zone.</p>
<p>5.2 It is <em>advised</em> that all drivers losing large amounts of time per lap to an approaching driver, whether it be a fight for position or they are being lapped, should move aside and voice their intentions.  This will reduce the risk of ruining someone else's race who is clearly faster than you and probably also ruining your own race.</p>
<p>6.  Races are held at Sunday 8pm Sydney, Australia time.</p>
<p>6.1 There is one race per week.</p>
<p>6.2 Races are typically 50% distance.  100% distance specials may be used for certain events.  This will be advertised in advance.</p>
<p>6.3 There is a 15 minute grace period before the start of each race to allow people to turn up for the race.  If all registered drivers are present before 8:15, qualifying will start.</p>
<p>6.4 Qualifying will be restarted in the event of a participant suffering a connection loss.  Only one connection loss per participant will cause a restart.  If a participant suffers two connection losses they forfeit the right to participate in the race.</p>
<p>6.5 Qualifying sessions will not be restarted after 8:30pm regardless of connection losses.  After this point, any participant suffering a connection loss is unable to join the race. </p>
<p>7. Races are run on the PC platform of F1 2011</p>
<p>8.  Ben Mansill (aka Flouncy) reserves the right to adjudicate over race incidents.  All questions should be directed to him on the Atomic forums.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>The basics of Springs</h3>
<p>The springs are suspension components whose job, on a road car, is to control the rate of compression of the shock absorbers.  Soft springs means the shock absorbers compress faster, providing a smoother ride and keeping the wheels in contact with the road more often.  It comes at the price of body roll and changing center of gravity, which makes the car feel like it's pitching and rolling through corners, decreasing the ability to change direction.</p>
<p>Harders springs are used in performance cars to reduce the body roll and increase the handling of the car.</p>
<p>In a Formula 1 car the springs are physcially attached a bit different but absorb the initial impact of bumps in the road.   Simply put, the softer the springs the more grip are car can generate in the corners (it can corner faster).</p>
<p>Springs also play a part on ride height (which thanks to the undertray of the car, and the diffuser, generates as much as 40% of the overall downforce on a Formula 1 car).</p>
<p>Springs in F1 2011 don't perfectly mimic their realworld counterparts, perhaps in part because the game doesn't have adjustment settings for dampers and packers too.</p>
<p>If you're care is understeering into corners and you feel you have the setup otherwise right, try reducing the front spring to enable more front grip.  Beware though, too much and your back end will be too loose and you'll lose it. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>In F1 2011 pre Patch 2</h3>
<p>Springs in F1 2011 before Patch 2 were very broken.  2 clicks harder would result in a consistent 2 second performance gain regardless of the circuit.</p>
<p>I'll start with same raw performance figures for springs.  As a basis for the test I ran laps of the Albert Park circuit in Melbourne Australia for the middle Quick Setup option, changing only the spring settings. </p>
<p>With the stock settings at 6/6 the following times were recorded</p>
<p><img src="~/media/18922/6-6 springs_650x273.jpg"  width="650"  height="273" alt="6-6 springs.png"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With all else left the same the springs were adjusted to 8/8</p>
<p><img src="~/media/18928/8-8 springs_650x299.jpg"  width="650"  height="299" alt="8-8 springs.png"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also peformed some runs with other settings.</p>
<p><strong>4 Front - 4 Rear</strong> : The car was consistently 2 seconds per lap slower than with the 6/6 setting.  The handling this time wsa noticeably worse in comparison to the 6/6 and 8/8 setup, both of which felt similar.</p>
<p><strong>2 Front - 2 Rear</strong> : The car was basically undriveable and a competitive lap time was not able to be set.  There were two noticeable characteristics here.  When braking heavily the front tyres would easily lock and would lock heavily.  On corner exit the car would oversteer massively (the back would come round and I'd be spinning).</p>
<p><strong>8 Front - 2 Rear</strong> : This configuration removed the brake lockups but the car oversteered at a whim on once past the apex, using the same amount of throttle as a 6/6 or 8/8 configuration.  Not competitive.</p>
<p><strong>2 Front - 8 Rear</strong> : This configuration resolved a lot of the oversteer issues but left the car with massive brake lockups under anything resembling a heavy brake load.</p>
<p>In both the biased (front bias or rear bias) configurations the car handling was terribly imbalanced.  This doens't necessarily mean that those spring settings should not be used at all. </p>
<p>Oversteer can be caused by a number of factors but the fundamental reason for it is because the front of the car is generating more grip than the rear of the car.  To compensate for the behaviour seen by a spring setting such as 8/2 more rear wing can be added, or front wing can be taken away.  Another possible cause of the oversteer is body roll in the corners. This can be remediated by increasing the rear anti-roll bar.</p>
<p>What I find confusing is that a softer spring setting should result in more rear grip and not less.  It may be that corner entry speed is increased, as the car would be pitching forward and yawing, as it slowed for the corner, then the center of gravit would be pushed backward as the car soft rear compresses as the car accelerates. This should give more rear traction out of the corner too, as the weight would be over the back wheels more, and more weight equals more friction equals more grip (see <a href="/{localLink:1313}" title="What is grip and how is it managed">What is grip and how is it managed</a>).</p>
<p>Equally confusing is the behaviour of the car with a rear bias spring setting.  With a softer front, the weight of the car should more quickly transfer to the front under brakes causing the car to understeer but definitely not lockup the brakes.  Brakes are more likely to lock when wheels have less grip with the road.  A wheel bouncing over bumps while braking will lock because it leaves the ground and has 0 grip.</p>
<p>Frankly, it seems the spring settings with regards to the dynamics of the car when springs are biased one way or the other are back to front.</p>
<p> </p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Codemasters F1 2011 introduces two new features KERS and DRS.  KERS offers a 80bhp power boost for approximately 8 seconds, while DRS is a drag reduction system, providing lower downforce and therefore higher speeds to the cars.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Qualifying</h3>
<p>The use of KERS and DRS in qualifying for an F1 2011 brings a small strategy element to the effort.</p>
<p>KERS can be applied at any time there is energy in the batteries. This available energy is noted by pressing your KERS button. If nothing changes on your wheel (no K beside the KERS value), you have nothing left. Otherwise you can use KERS.  My qualifying strategy is to save all your KERS for end of the qualifying warmup lap.  Toward the end of your warm up lap, start using KERS at a time where you'll run out of KERS as you cross the start-finish line, where it will be recharged again.  I prefer to save my KERS for when I'm in the mid to high gears, 4th or above and on a long straight. </p>
<p>Whether or not you use all the KERS before the start/finish straight of your hot lap is track dependant, but I like to save a bit for the end, particularly if I'm going to go for another hot lap. If you're happy with your sector 1 and 2 times it's a good idea to burn through your KERS before the last corner of the lap, preferrably when existing low speed corners.</p>
<p>As DRS usage is unlimited on qualifying laps, I use DRS whenever my front wheels are point straight and I'm past the apex of a corner.  I manually turn off DRS prior to entering corners where I'm not using the brake.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Race</h3>
<p>The same amount of KERS is available during the race as in qualifying.  DRS is limited to only one or two places on the track and then only when you are within 1 second of the car in front at the activiation zone.  And then, only from lap 3 onwards and not in wet conditions.</p>
<p>KERS should be deployed at the start of the race once your wheels stop spinning.  How much you use depends on where your car is positioned (who is in front of you).  If you've got drivers in front that will be slower off the line but are blockers, you may not want to use your KERS off the line, as you'll waste your advantage.  Wait until you are right up behind them.</p>
<p>Once the start procedure has been completed KERS can be deployed as per a qualifying lap, when you are in clear air.</p>
<p>KERS introduces some options for defensive and aggressive driving, using it's power boost to both help defend against cars looking to put a pass on you, and you wanting to make a move on a car in front.  Most tracks only have a few passing opportunities and your KERS should be saved so it can be deployed at this places, to maximise your drive out of the corner.  To that end, if using KERS to pass it's adviseable to get your car pointing out of the corner as earlier as possible, especially in comparisson to the person you are attempting to pass.  This will ensure your have maximum grip and can make the most of the extra power at your disposal.  Again, be careful to not spin the wheels up when deploying KERS or you'll be wasting it.</p>
<p>Naturally you'll want to use DRS whever you can during a race.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>There are two ways to approach the Atomic F1 competition, one being to turn up on race day and maybe get in an hours practice prior to the race using a quick setup, the second being to develop a setup during the week.  If you want to be competitive for the race then you're going to need to practice.  Be assured the top guys do; even those that already have a setup from previous meets at the same circuit.<br /><br />Here's a basic strategy for developing a competitive car for a race weekend.<br /><br /><strong>6 Days out</strong>: Start with the middle Quick Setup and put in enough laps so that you lapping consistently.  This is your baseline.  Without this there is no point in starting to investigate custom car setup.  Until the springs issue is resolved (and maybe after it), the most influential component in your cars setup is springs, so start adjusting those.  At first set to 8/8 and do at least 5 consistent laps, to get a feel and time benchmark.  If the car feels completely horrid immediately, just stop.  Use your judgement.  Next move the springs to 1/1 or 2/2.  You want a drastic change so you can feel just how different it is. Again, turn in 5 good laps.  Adjust springs until satisfied.  Next move on to Wings.  Repeat this for the various car components until the car is feeling very consistent.  The main thing is being able to turn consistent laps.  A fast car is not so useful if you can't stay on track for more than a few laps.  Try a few hot laps, learning the KERS and DRS points.<br /><br /><strong>5 Days out</strong>: Long Run Day. The aim for today is to establish tyre wear and fuel consumption given your car setup.  Remember a fully fuelled car is gong to handle worse than an empty car.  You may need to raise the ride height to counter the extra weight.  Fill the car with 20+ Laps of fuel and prime tyres and set out from pits.  Build up pace and heat in your tyres, feeling the extra weight of the car.  Remember today you're just trying to understand how long you can go on a set of tyres.  Ideally aim for 1 stop during the race, and the races are about 25 laps, so you want to get around 17-20 laps from a set of tyres and a 20 lap fuel load.<br /><br /><strong>4 Days out</strong>: Time for some fun. Bolt on some options, drop your ride height, suck your gut in and man up, it's time to try your qualifying pace.  Set your fuel mixture to rich, and perform a slow out lap, then hang it out :D<br /><br /><strong>3 Days out</strong>: While we'd like for it to always be sunny, with clear skies, nature isn't always acommodating.  Start a new Grand Prix with a fully wet setting and repeat the steps from 6 Days out.  I wouldn't worry too much about a qualifying time.  Get used to the wet weather handling and work on your race setup<br /><br /><strong>2 Days out</strong>:  Somewhere in between bone dry and soaking wet, will lie intermediate.  If you're happy with your dry setup and ok with your wet, try some intermediate running.  Repeat the steps from 6 Days out.  If your dry pace is still wanting, continue days 6 - 4.<br /><br /><strong>1 Day out</strong>: Have a beer and rest.<br /><br /><strong>Race Day</strong>: Log in an hour before race start to check your game install, your wheel, and your mic.  An hour should give you enough time to correct any problems (such as low batteries, or a misconfigured wheel).  I'd also advise doing 20 or so warmup laps.</p>
<p>You can also reduce your workload by sharing duties with your teammate.</p>]]></bodyText>

<p>Driving in the rain can be a treacherous experience but finding the right wet weather setup can help make it a lot less hazardous. </p>
<p>Wet weather car setups are all about maximising grip, both mechanical and aero.  You want the highest wing settings and the softest springs you can run while maintaining your car balance.  Ride height is critical here too, but in the opposite direction of a dry weather setup.  Too little ground clearance and the bottom of your car is splashing through puddles.  Also, very soft spring settings makes a low ride height not very good.</p>
<p>Basically you want to set your front and rear wings to 11 and raise your ride height to 11 front and rear.  Also run the lowest braking pressure, to avoid lockups.  You can also save some weight by reducing the size of the brake ducts.  Because it's raining and likely cooler, you don't need them so large. You're also not generating as much heat in your brakes becuase you cannot brake as hard. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most crucial to a driveable car is gear ratios.  Here you can either use the same gear ratios as in the dry, but short shift, or you can select really long ratios and minimise torque and therefore wheelspin.  My preference is to go long gear ratios because I like to see all the pretty lights on my wheel and it saves some effort in paying so much attention to that area. </p>
<p>The strategy for developing a setup for the wet is pretty much the same as the dry.  Make adjustments to one component at a time pay attention to it's effects.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>A corner-stone of the "complete" F1 experience is telemetry. Despite Codemasters marketing F1 2011 as living the life of an F1 racer, and being a complete package, the game doesn't come with accessible telemetry out of the box.  Probably to make it easy (dumb) enough for console gamers.</p>
<p>PC users don't have such limitations and there is a way to get access to telemetry data.  I noticed there is a telemetry folder for F1 2011, but the files are binary.  I went looking on the Internet...</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/f1-2011-misc-102/f1-2011-data-logger-5866/">application written by kenken on the RaceDepartment site</a>.</p>
<p>I've zipped up a F1 2011 Utils folder with F1 PerfView and F1 2011 Data Logger.  Download it from <a href="/media/22535/f1-telemetry.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Capturing Telemetry</h3>
<p>The F1 2011 Data Logger application needs to be running while F1 2011 is running and listens via TCP for a connection from the game.  You can adjust a game config file to point to the location of kenken's data logger.</p>
<p>You need to set various settings of the logger dependant on which car and which track you're racing on.  For most the competitors of the Atomic F1 competition this won't be a problem because you'll be testing the same track in the same car all week, prior to the race.</p>
<p><img src="/media/22385/logger.png" width="310" height="322" alt="logger.png"/></p>
<p>In my case I'll always leave the Car setting as McLaren, and I'll change the GP value each week.  The other setting you need to change is the Directory. </p>
<p>Once you've done that you need to point your F1 2011 config to the logger.  To do this open the file "hardware_settings_config.xml".  This is found in your <strong>My Documents</strong> folder in the subpath <strong>./My Games/FormulaOne2011/hardwaresettings/</strong>. </p>
<p>Open the file in your favourite text editor and change the line</p>
<p><img src="/media/22363/old-telem-setting.PNG" alt="old-telem-setting.PNG"/></p>
<p>to be</p>
<p><img src="/media/22357/new-telem-setting.PNG" alt="new-telem-setting.PNG"/></p>
<p>This will redirect telemetry data to kenken's data logger.</p>
<p>Now press the <strong>Connect</strong> button to start the programme listening for a TCP connection from F1 2011.  Open your game and do as many laps as you want, and when you're done press <strong>Disconnect</strong> (the Connect button will change text once connected).  You then need to hit the <strong>Save </strong>button to save the changes to your data folder (which is included in the zip you downloaded).</p>
<p><img src="/media/22369/save-telem-data.PNG" width="163" height="29" alt="save-telem-data.PNG"/></p>
<h3>Analysing the Data</h3>
<p>Collecting this information isn't much use if there's no way to display it.  To my amazement, the tool to use is the same tool as I used for Grand Prix 2 15 years ago.  I found when I downloaded the package from the author <a href="http://rsdi.home.xs4all.nl/docs/f1perfview_doc.html">Rene Smit</a>, it didn't have the MFC71.dll included and my machine didn't have it.  Figuring most all new machines wont have this, I've included it in the above zip.  It sits in the same folder as F1PerfView.</p>
<p>To analyse some captured laps, open the tool and select <strong>Open </strong>from the menu. Change the file type filter to be <strong>All Files (*.*)</strong> and navigate to your data directory where you saved the csv files the data logger produced.</p>
<p>I like to display the Raw Lap data, the Circuit Map, and the graph.</p>
<p><img src="~/media/22307/telemetry_900x542.jpg"  width="900"  height="542" alt="telemetry.png"/></p>
<p>The next guide in this series will detail how to use telemetry and F1 Perf View to develop a car setup. Coming soon!</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>It's hard to imagine that anything performed while seated is physically taxing, and yet, Formula One is one of the most physically demanding sports a competitor can undertake.  While it's true that at a base level drivers are seated inside a car, it's the intense physicality of the sport, the g-forces exerted on the body during acceleration, deceleration, and corning that begin to make it difficult for drivers.  Pulling 4g’s through a corner makes the drivers weight increase by a factor of 4, so a 10kg head suddenly weighs 40 kilos and the neck must be able to support that strain.</p>
<p>Formula 1 is a sport where success is measured in the thousandths of a second and maximum concentration must be applied to an entire qualifying and race effort, with races up to two hours in duration.  The effects of the tight confines of the cockpit, the high temperatures of the track and car, and the gforces exerted on the body all work together to drain the body, through sustain high levels of physical exertion.  Once the body starts to fatigue, concentration starts to be effected and lap times can increase, or worse, the driver can have an accident. </p>
<p>Besides the physical effects of motor racing on the body, the act of concentrating itself can increase stresses on the body and increase fatigue, effecting concentration.</p>
<p>While we only compete in a virtual environment with force feedback wheels, and the few of us with more expensive additions, we’re all still subjected to high levels of sustained concentration and elevated stress levels, as the pressure of having to perform at 100% manifests during qualifying and the race, particularly the start.</p>
<p>During the Season 4 Germany Grand Prix atomicf1.com strapped a heart rate monitor to Mclaren driver TurrbalTerror in bit to better understand just what virtual racers, and to a tiny extent, racing drivers themselves, undergo as they battle for a win.</p>
<p>The following graph is the recording of two qualifying sessions and a 50% full distance race of the Nurburgring circuit in Codemasters F1 2011. During this event TurrbalTerror was one of the favourites to win the race, his first win of the season, and had plenty of his own high expectations, also increasing his own stress levels.  He started from pole position and on the first corner was tagged and then on the second last corner of the first lap was tagged again, this time relegating him to ninth place, requiring a strategic rise up the grid if he was to recoup even some of the potential points haul he was expecting.  His strategy saw him save fuel during the early stages of the race, with the intent of focussing 100% on a series of ‘qualifying’ style laps at the end of the race, when fuel loads would be light and the stickier Option tyres fresh.</p>
<p><img src="/media/28003/heartrate.png" alt="heartrate.png"/></p>
<p>TurrbalTerror’s typical seated heart rate is about 72 beats per minute.  Already the anticipation of racing has his heart rate elevated to over 100 beats per minute.</p>
<p>There are 4 marked segments of this graph where the drivers heart rate spiked and interesting these spike events all map directly to a typical period of high stress during the race.</p>
<p>1)      Qualifying Session 1 – Dry running.  TurrbalTerror tried an alternate strategy in stint one, on the slower prime tyres, before coming back out for another run on sticky option tyres.</p>
<p>2)      Qualifying Session 2 – Wet Weather session where he set pole position in one run then waited in the garage for the other drivers to complete their laps.  An initial dramatic rise in heart rate was evident during his focussed qualifying run, with the heart rate dropping once he sat in the pits.</p>
<p>3)      Race start – Suffered to hits on the first lap which knocked him back to 9<sup>th</sup> place and only a few seconds from last.</p>
<p>4)      Final stint on Option tyres and Rich fuel, catching the cars in front at seconds per lap and ultimately finishing in 3<sup>rd</sup> position, less than 10 seconds from 2<sup>nd</sup> place.</p>
<p>It’s evident in this graph that it’s not just the physical demands of racing that take their toll on race drivers.  The mental aspect and the stress of the sport itself also plays a significant part. </p>
<p>A future study could be conducted using stress inhibitors such as alcohol to see if that both lowers heart rate and increases performance. It’s possible, even likely, that increased heart rate and stress level help to improve reflexes, reaction times, and ultimately lap times.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Atomic F1's first outing and the field was massively spread out with the drivers who practice the most starting up the front of the grid.  The race is interesting in that season 4 speed king, bobaj0r was massively off the pace.  Also absent was TurrbalTerror, who's wheel failed causing him to get disqualified as he rolled out of the pits to start his very first lap in the competition, sort of setting the scene for his races; a trent that continues on well into season 4.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flouncy</strong><br />One of my fav tracks. Lovely speedy go kart track. Nothing to tell, got pole, got away, Lambo was a few lengths back for a couple of laps, then he disappeared to be replaced by kikz. I had a comfy lead so just maintained pace, turned the engine down and drove to preserve tires. Eventually kikz disappeared so I just cruised around quickly and cleanly. Apart from a slight twitch on turn 1 lap 1 that I caught, a flawless drive.<br /><br /><strong>Atomic Lambo</strong><br />I would vote this and China as the most technical tracks in the calander. Sepang Has at least 3 or 4 very very technical corners that if you don't get right you lose lap time. Any how qualifying I went out early and banked a hot lap. It was solid but not fast, there was easly another 6 tenths or more to get from it. I went out on a second set of tires and was up 5 tenths in the first sector alone when I caught up to Mac dude which was unfortunate because I think that would have been a very hot lap. There was not enough time to pit and put another set on so I went out and tried on the same set. Unfortunately not as much grip as it had on the opening lap and only went up about 3 tenths on my time. Had to settle for 3rd on the grid, but easly could have been 2nd and might have troubled Ben for pole. The race I had a good start off the line. Went into the first corner right on the gearbox of Ben. Ben made a small mistake out of turn one and nearly lost it but did well to hold onto it. Going into turn 3 I breaked to turn in and Bollum comes flying out of nowhere taking me off the track. I resumed just behind Bollum and fast starting Fredz. Turn 4 fredz went off, and into turn 5 bollum took a strange line and I made a solid pass on him. I spent the next 3 odd laps catching up to Ben which I did. However on turn 9 turning into the corner, Kikz hit me and I lost the place. Not sure how you thought there was room to do that or if you out breaked yourself but it came from no where. I resumed in 3rd but had Ghost all over me. Going intot the final corner I got tagged but still ok, but on the next lap got tagged again and spun. However in a show of great sportsman ship Ghost waited till I resumed and allowed me to take my place, and in my opinion based on the finishing times, probably easily cost him victory. I made a mistake on the next lap that put ghost back infront of me anyway. I followed for another 2 laps and we both pitted on lap 8 or 9 with me right behind Ghost. Must have been a quick pitstop as I then came out ahead of him. But I struggled on the hard tires for a lap or two and eventually he passed me when I made a mistake. From then on it was a lonely race. Ghost obviously with that delay of 15 odd seconds letting me through and then the delay in the pits probably might have cost him. Overall a dissapointing result considering the early laps.<br /><br /><strong>TurrbalTerror</strong><br />Malaysia was interesting. I went faster in qualifying practice than I did in multiplayer mode. Not sure way. I wouldn't have got pole. I probably still would have been fourth with a mid 1:35, but I just couldn't do it. The first 5 or 6 laps were fantastic. I got off the line decentish and followed Ghost into the turn but he slowed rather drastically and I think someone tapped him. I took it pretty easy through the first few turns, so as not to trip up, and was 6th through those first. By the time I got the end of the lap I was a close 4th with Ghost right in front. I felt I had a lot more speed and was keeping up easily. Not sure what happened to ghost. I think he ran wide. Anyway, I took my opportunity and closed up behind Lambo and Flouncy not far ahead. I was glued to Lambo's gearbox on through turns 7 and 8. Coming in to T9 I took my chance and stuck my nose up the inside. Lambo turned in and I hit him. My fault. After that I took caught up behind Flouncy give or take a second or two. Pit stops came a few laps later and I pitted first I think. I came out in fourth again but got second back after the pitstops were done. Ghost started catching me pretty quickly at about lap 15 and I defended my line. Not sure when the pass was made or why, but Ghost took off after that and I settled for the bottom of the podium. My first this year.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flouncy</strong><br />This track always seems like work, still nice with a cool blend of fast variable throttle corners. You really need to manage the throttle so carefully on several corners here...<br /><br />Had a good start off the line and Lambo right in front of me didn't. I had enough speed on him to be at least side by side turning into turn 1, if not past him, but the cheeky bugger saw this and moved to block me, had to lift off... s'alright, I would have done the same thing.<br /><br />Then it was kikz blazing ahead, ghost, lambo and me. A couple of laps in on turn 1 I was following Lambo and he went a bit wide while my line is to follow the curb in the last part, so in a flash I was inside Lambo - it wasn't an overtaking move, just found myself there in a blink of an eye, I did brake to slow and get behind you safely but you turned back in too quickly and we touched. Sorry about that, wasn't going for a move there...<br /><br />A couple of laps later I tapped kikz, you went invisible right as I was close and I couldn't tell where you were. That hardly happens so unsure why the game decided to do that. In any case I tapped you, so sorry about that.<br /><br />Then it was me and ghosty, I had the lead for a good while and he was enough car lengths behind to give me comfort, but threaten me all the time. I went wide on that bloody second last corner (end of the epic straight - you know, the place that costs you races...) and he was by. I stayed behind for a while til he pulled away a football field length.<br /><br />Last few laps I was safely in 2nd enough to really take risks and push, engine on fast and went all out. Seemed to close a bit but not enough, til last couple of laps all of a sudden I was on him. Not quite enough to challenge, though fredz positioned himself nicely on the second last corner right between us, but alas it didn't help me.</p>
<p><br /><br /><strong>Lambo</strong><br />Shaghai is also a pet hate. Not because it's technical, which it is, has a similar first corner chain that you need to get right to get the best drive out of the second bend, but because it's bumpy. So bumpy. Especially the back straight corner, really hard to get a good setup. Had a decent qualifying lap, but lack of practice this week really hurt me as I did probably 2 or 3 more laps then I would have liked. I had a badish start. Got of the line ok but I knew ben starting in 4th would be behind me on the grid, and If I've learned anything from Singapore...and Korea....and Melbourne....he'll attack the inside. Getting off the line I short shifted 3rd but deliberately parked my car on the very inside to deny Ben the chance of going up the inside (you never got beside me Ben, if you had, youd be in the wall). Kikz had a monster start. While I was busy defending Ben I forgot about him and he navigated around the outside of me, and then the inside of Ghost. Looked very good on the replay. Next lap or so Ben chased me but into the first corner I took a wider line as to have the inside going into the second corner, but had contact with Ben. I havn't seen the replay yet, but it was quite a shunt and sent me spinning. From then on it was a lonely race in 4th. Overall a dissapointing round. While I made mistakes I lost chunks of time to incidents that didn't fell were my fault. But with the fly races done thankfully, we have two tracks comeing up which I do love. Catalyuna and Monaco. Hope to do better at Monaco considering the disspoaintment of last season.</p>
<p><br /><strong>TurrbalTerror</strong><br />China was ok. I had good qualifying speed and could was close. Closer than Sepang anyway. I really enjoy the first few turns and I think I've always done exceptionally well there. I got into first place from the start and led for the first 6-7 laps Ghost start to mount an effort. We battled closely, with me actively defending lines. We had an both had an off on the hairpin after the straight as I took the inside line and he went left. Ghost was probably being polite and not turning in on me. I missed my break point being too concerned with defending and would have certainly hit Ghost if he turned in. I managed to get back on track still in the lead but Flouncy was close behind. He came up in the inside in turn 1 and I got tapped sending me off into the sand to jump a few curbs. Not too bad. I was about 4-5 second back and in 3rd when I got on track. A few laps later Fredzfrog was off on the same turn and as he joined the track he also joined my sidepod. no damage but again an off and a few more seconds lost. I made an error on 6 for 4 consecutive laps near the end, when Bollum was close behind. In the end I cruised into a comfortable 3rd.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>It was clear from the outset of the Spanish Atomic F1 GP that the majority of the teams and drivers had been practicing this track.  Lines were tidy and times were low.  Spain saw the re-introduction of Season 1 racer bobaj0r, returning from his stint in NASCAR to join the cast of regulars.</p>
<p>Qualifying was pretty much as expected with Flouncy taking first place from TurrbalTerror, HolyGhost79, Atomic Lambo, bobabj0r, OriginalBollum, Fredzfrog and a rapidly improving BreakerMorant.</p>
<p>As the pack left the start grid it appeared someone had forgot to tell TurrbalTerror there was a race on, as he stood on the grid while all but Mac Dude drove around him.  TurrbalTerror later reported a clutch problem on his Mclaren. After the first few laps TurrbalTerror had regained ground.  Having dispatched Fredzfrog and OriginalBollum by turn 4 of lap 1 he stuck to the back of bobaj0r and Atomic Lambo while Ghost and Flouncy opened a small gap.  A few laps in and Atomic Lambo had a slip on the astro-turf, letting bobaj0r go and TurrbalTerror go past.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerror caught up to Flouncy, where they battled for a few laps, exchanging places as each pushed the other a little too hard.  On lap 8 TurrbalTerror spun on the final corner and damaged his front wing, immediately pitting for repairs.</p>
<p>Both Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror pushed hard to catch the leading pack and both spun on a number of occasions, eventually settling for 4<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> places respectively.</p>
<p>Final Race results saw HolyGhost lead Flouncy, TurrbalTerror, Atomic Lambo, bobaj0r, OriginalBollum, FredzFrog, and BreakerMorant</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We know whenever we go to Monte Carlo we're going to witness a display of ultimate car control and application of brake and throttle at the hands of Monaco specialist Atomic Lambo.   His laps of Monaco rival the great Ayrton Senna for his ability to find the edge then push past it.  The qualifying time demonstrated this and embarrassed other "fast" drivers, including the current championship leader HolyGhost79.</p>
<p>Competitors didn't hold much hope of anything but second place and it was clear from lap one that that was the best they could hope for.</p>
<p>Watch the race highlights below to see what all the fuss is about.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The Season 3 atomicf1 Turkish GP was a close fought affair from the outset, and with the top qualifiers separated by less than a second the indicators were there early. </p>
<p>The first corner was not without incident, as pole sitter bobaj0r led from TurrbalTerror and fast starting Flouncy.  TurrbalTerror braked early, to leave Flouncy room and was nudged by Atomic Lambo enough to tap Flouncy who was trying to go round the outside.</p>
<p>It looked like being a hard fought battle between the Mclaren teammates until bobaj0r went off on the entry to turn 7, giving a clear lead to TurrbalTerror.  Krispy89 and Fredzfrog made brilliant starts through the first few turns but couldn't keep their cars planted on track after turn 4 of lap 1. </p>
<p>TurrbalTerror and Ghost pitted at the end of lap seven, giving the lead to Flouncy who led until lap 16, when the chasing pair of HolyGhost79 and TurrbalTerror caught, with TurrbalTerror effecting a pass through turns 2, 3, and 4, before Flouncy spun out of contention on the exit of turn 9.</p>
<p>From there, it a was a quiet race to the flag for TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost, with Flouncy finishing in a hard fought third.</p>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Everyone was expecting it, an Atomic Lambo win, on this one of his more dominant tracks.  The event started well for Atomic Lambo, with pole position by a small margin over Flouncy. </p>
<p>Atomic Lambo held the usually fast starting Flouncy at bay with some aggressive defending through the turn 3, where arguably Flouncy had his wheels past the mid point of the Force India car. No doubt one for the stewards and the fans on internet forums around the world to argue over. Once Atomic Lambo was through there was little stand in his way, besides the concrete wall on the inside of the pit straight, which attract him, along with a number of other drivers throughout the race.<br /><br />After the round of scheduled stops the race had a new leader, HolyGhost79 who had pulled away to an impressive lead, followed by Flouncy, TurrbalTerror, and Atomic Lambo.  Atomic Lambo made his move when TurrbalTerror lost traction and ended facing perpendicular to the racing line, before a correcting - losing a few seconds.  <br /><br />Krispy89 had an impressive drive on his return to racing weekend, giving the more established drivers a hard time at moments before succumbing to his own inconsistency. Krispy89 is a driver to watch and with a little more consistency he will be a regular podium contender.  <br /><br />McLaren number two and recent returnee had a race he'll soon forget, with an unspiring qualifying and a drive backwards through the pack, his lack of track time evident.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Valencia saw the arrival of a new talent, ET ROM au, in an impressive debut where he finished well up the order and kept his nose clean.</p>
<p>After a dry qualifying Valencia saw the first wet race of the season and boy did it rain hard.  The first lap, with the pack bunched up, was reminiscent of Adelaide 1991 when the race was stopped at after 14 laps, and probably what it was like at Malaysia in 2009.  Visibility was near non existant as the pack slithered and slide around the track, with Flouncy pulling a 5+ second lead before half of the first lap was completed.  The pack came round to the bridge and saw Flouncy parked beside wall, probably putting his gumboots on.  From there, HolyGhost79 showed the pack the way as mistakes continued a plenty.</p>
<p>As the track dried as some were starting to think about pitting for intermediate or dry tyres, Atomic Lambo blinked first and pitted for Options.  A move that would see him capitalised on new found levels of grip, if only for a short period.  TurrbalTerror followed close behind on the same lap and pitted for intermediates, in a hope to replicate his Season 2 feats of cutting 3+ seconds a lap out of the leaders times, but it was not to be, as the inters proved worthless, with TurrbalTerror not able to replicate his full wet tyre pace of 1:45.9. </p>
<p>Atomic Lambo eventually lost his lead to Flouncy, after an inspired drive from the back of the back.  Clearly his gumboots kept his toes dry and provided the level of comfort other drivers only wished they had.</p>
<p>HolyGhost79 also pitted, but his crew fumbled his stop and put wet weather tyres back on and out he went, putting it into the wall at the first turn and forcing a re-pit, this time for dry primes.  It was enough for TurrbalTerror to get by into fourth, but not enough for  him to hold HolyGhost79 off, demonstrating why dry tryres are better than wet tyres when the sun is out.</p>
<p>Flouncy describes Valencia season 3 as his most rewarding drive ever, and with a come from last place on lap 1 to the lead, it's not hard to see why.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>It was clear from the off that Flouncy meant business at Silverstone.  His pole time of 1:31.085 stands as the fastest lap we've yet seen of this circuit at a race meet and was significantly faster than second placed HolyGhost79. This gird had a larger spread that the previous few races.</p>
<p>Race day threw up another doozie, with heavy rain yet again.  Flouncy made a clean start as the pack slipped and slid through the first few corners, battling over minor positions.  The end of lap 1 was exciting, as HolyGhost79, bobaj0r, and TurrbalTerror all jockeyed for 2nd position coming out of the last corner.  bobaj0r got squeezed by HolyGhost79 into TurrbalTerror as HolyGhost79 past TurrbalTerror, but both went off on turn 1 of lap 2 and bobaj0r was back in second place before his own mistakes cost him a higher finish.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerror lost more and more ground over the first five laps as he drove clean off the track on more corners than not, losing out a whooping gap of 45 seconds to bobaj0r in fourth place.  It was a gap that was to stay consistent until the end of the race.</p>
<p>Flouncy had his own misfortune when his steering dettached from the cockpit and he was lucky to salvage fourth place in front of a luckless Atomic Lambo who was forced to pull off track to take answer his phone.  Maybe Force India will invest in a handsfree before the next event. Although driving whilst talking on the phone is not against FIA regulations.</p>
<p>The misfortunes of two of the leading front runners was the fortunes of the fans, as it enabled the chasing pack to close up in points, but HolyGhost79 to extend his points lead ever so marginally.  Fortunately over the whole weekend, Flouncy and HolyGhost both had finished in P1 and P4, with only qualifying points difference the decider, and that swung in second place Flouncy's direction.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>With the battle between Flouncy and HolyGhost79 so close, results in Korea were always going to be hard fought and extremely important to both drivers.   HolyGhost79 grabbed his gauntlet and in true monty python style figuratively slapped Flouncy across the face with it as he threw it down at his opponents feet, with an impressive pole time, 0.2s clear of second placed, and returning driver, TurrbalTerror. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As with most races, turn one lap one provided probably the most dangerous corner of the race, with the a near affray as 9 ambitions  were funnelled through one small point in space and time.  While a modicum of respectability was afforded to all at the pointy end, the more ambitious brought the battle to them with TurrbalTerror and Flouncy both forced offline through contact.  Fortunately this gave Ghost time to recover and keep his lead.  ET Rom au then shot one up the port side of the leading pack as they entered turn 2, giving 10 second penalties to both Flouncy and TurrbalTerror. </p>
<p>Once the madness of the first few turns had passed, the pack settled down into a familiar order and by the end of lap one, Ghost and Flouncy were out front doing what it is they do best.  While the strategic skirmish up front played out, the battle for best of the race was raging, with divebombing, spins, slides and tears aplenty.  Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror duked it out for 3rd spot, trading blows lap by lap, with TurrbalTerror slowing down to keep the battle alive, finally to away in the last few laps to ensure a podium.  Much to his dismay he’d forgot about the 10 second penalty handed out for his part in the first corner goings on and it was enough to bump him back to fourth and wonder about what could have been.</p>
<p>Much the surprise of even himself, BreakerMorant crossed the finish line in a career best fifth place, earning his HRT team some well needed cash for next season.  The last of the finishes was debutant CruiserComet, who at one point was as high as fourth position on lap 1. </p>
<p>With two races remaining, HolyGhost79 is back in the lead of the championship.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Now the race is over one thing is clear, the championship battle is not.  Brazil shouldn’t have been surprising to anyone.  With HolyGhost79 dominating the previous race, history would have it that Brazil was Flouncy’s turn to dominate.  History, as it usually is, proved correct.  Flouncy tore up the Brazilian circuit colloquially known as the ‘Interlagos kart track’ in a record 1:09.985, putting pole position beyond the reach of his fellow drivers.  HolyGhost79 didn’t disappoint either, snatching 2nd position in the final stages of qualifying.  The front two rows of the grid were completed by the usual protagonists, Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror, making the most of his 10 laps of the Brazilian circuit in the last 2 seasons count.</p>

<p>Thankfully Brazil did not see a repeat of the first turn of Korea, with the entire pack getting away cleanly.  The top four blasted down the back straight for the first time, braking heavily for turn three on cold tyres.  MaverickROM wanted to make the most of his start and used TurrbalTerrors gearbox as his braking aid as he shot into fourth place.  TurrbalTerror recovered unfazed and in dead last and 10th place, in the one of the fullest fields ever to grace the competition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the two contenders shot off into the distance, TurrbalTerror began his climb back through the pack and had claimed 9 by two turns later and was in 8th in another corner.  7th and 6th were dispatched on the same corners on lap two and scything through the pack was on in earnest and by the end of lap 4 he was in 5th place. </p>
<p>HolyGhost79 and Flouncy continued to trade sectors as they each attemped to assert supremacy over the other.  On lap 7 roxa3sora3 moved over onto the racing line to let TurrbalTerror by, which resulted, naturally, in a collision, as TurrbalTerror followed him onto the line.  The erractic Brisbanite continued on with only minor front wing damage; nothing a tweak to the front wing settings couldn’t fix.  Soon he was up in 3rd position, after passing MaverickROM and Atomic Lambo, the later having a short break in the infield at the bottom of the hill leading up the pit straight.  Turrball’s stint in 3rd was limited to only a couple of laps, as he misjudged just how far out into the track one of the barriers extend on the run up the hill toward the pits, and broke his front wing off entirely.  Fortunately it was a only a short distance to the pits. </p>
<p>With no hope of catching the leading duo, or that of Atomic Lambo, the oft erratic McLaren driver started, what ET Rom AU described as “playing” with the slower drivers, waiting for them to pass, only to repass them a number of corners later, then repeating.  While it’s not a new practice for TurrbalTerror, it’s most probably a practice that doesn’t sit well with race officials but none-the-less is hard to police. </p>
<p>When the flag dropped, it was the two that kept their noses clean, as they have most the season, that crossed the line in the places that mattered most.  This time with Flouncy in the lead and HolyGhost79 trailing.  What we’ve now got is a very exciting prospect.  The championship will be decided at the last race. </p>
<p>HolyGhost79 must bring his A game to walk away with the crown.  That much is certain.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>In the end it came down to a little over 2 seconds.  That’s the size of the gap between champion Flouncy and contender HolyGhost79.  The fairytail didn’t go as planned though. Flouncy had eyes on a pole to flag win and he looked good at the midway point, with a lap of 1:40.259.  TurrbalTerror managed a 1:40.5, to provisionally fill second place.  A lap later TurrbalTerror crossed the line in 1:40.129, only to better it on the next lap with a 1:39.744.  Atomic Lambo and HolyGhost79 were still to mount their assaults on pole but ultimately they would fall short, some 2.2183s and 2.620s respectively.  The rest of the field was spread evenly back to BreakerMorant at the tail end, crossing the line in 1:48.176. 107% was 1:46.726.</p>
<p>As the pack got away the Group Force India in second place made it’s usual stunning getaway and had it’s nose ahead into turn 1.  Flouncy backed off, not wanting to lose the championship on the first corner, while TurrbalTerror kept it wide not wanting to get in the way of a potentially epic battle.  Atomic Lambo saw his gap and took it, through into second place at turn two, leaving TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost79 in to start the battle for the bottom podium position.</p>
<p>A few laps in and HolyGhost79 went past TurrbalTerror after he ran it wide on Turn 17 and stayed off track while HolyGhost79 went past.  Turrbal clawed back the 3 second gap by the next lap and the dicing between himself, HolyGhost79 and Atomic Lambo was back on, continuing past the first round of pit stops which all three took at the end of lap 7.  The on track battle helped Flouncy to extend his lead to comfortable 15 seconds by the middle of the race and it seemed the race was done and dusted.</p>
<p>HolyGhost79 was not going to give up that easily and through the second half of the race he reduced the gap down to a visible 2.6s.  Ultimately the race long battle he fought with his car beat him, as he spun on the final lap, preventing any possible final confrontation and putting the championship winner beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Well done to Flouncy on another spectacular title win.  What do the other drivers have to do to overcome this phenom.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>1st - Flouncy - Ferrari</strong><br />Controlled and measured drive. Handled the first corner setback well and set himself up for a comfortable win with good strategy and consistent pace. Never really looked troubled.<br /><br /><strong>2nd - Atomic Lambo - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />A solid drive. Kept out of trouble, was mistake free, but just didn't quite have the overall pace that the Ferrari did. Suffered some tire degradation during the first stint that allowed Flouncy to catch up, but solid after that. Gave the Ferrari a small scare during the second stint, as well as an incident with 3rd place ET-Rom, but overall a good drive.<br /><br /><strong>3rd - ET-ROM - Mercedes</strong><br />The surprise package of the new season so far. Vastly improved over the testing break, ET was perhaps the dark horse to shake things up and indeed he did. Putting the Mercedes on pole, all be it by the smallest of margins to claim is maiden pole. Got away well at the start and built and sustained a solid lead. By the second stint the race win was less likely, however second was well within grasp but a mistake into the last turn would see the Renault of Lambo steal the position. Regardless a stunning podium and only his 3rd so far. We are sure we'll see more.<br /><br /><strong>4th - roxas3sora3 - Williams</strong><br />Perhaps a vote for drive of the round. A solid drive from the Williams driver saw a recovery from 7th on the grid to finishing 4th, just off the podium. Keeping relatively out of trouble and avoiding some of the chaos behind, roxas put in a solid drive to round out the top 4. Vastly improved over last season, another young talent to watch.<br /><br /><strong>5th - HOLYGHOST79 - Lotus</strong><br />Not the best start to a season from the Lotus driver, give his explosive start to season 3 and missing out on the drivers championship by only 16 points. A relatively disappointing race give he was an early favorite amongst the book makers. A number of mistakes saw last seasons runner up tangle with a number of drivers. A number of pundits criticized his pre-season preparation, and perhaps rightfully so. He never looked comfortable and number of errors was telling. A 20 second penalty for his hit on TurrbalTerror was warranted. Hopefully he bounces back next race in Malaysia.<br /><br /><strong>6th - CruiserComet - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />A good start to the season for the new Lotus-Renault drive. Steep learning curve but has plenty of potential. Qualified a solid 6th place and through patience was rewarded with 6th finishing ahead above the highly rated Eradicator and TurrbalTerror. Stayed out of relative trouble, one or two mistakes, but a good start to the season and critical points for the constructors championship.<br /><br /><strong>7th - Eradicator84 - Williams</strong><br />After a season hiatus Eradicator was back driving for Williams. Eradicators last race was round 19 of season two, so there was alot of interest to see how he'd fair after a season out of the sport. Qualifying a solid 7th considering, his race was also solid, if somewhat unspectacular. As he gets up to speed he will be very dangerous. A good points haul for Williams with both cars finishing the race.<br /><br /><strong>8th - TurrbalTerror - McLaren</strong><br />One of the early favorites having completed extensive pre-season testing, however was mared by bad luck and a number of run ins. Early contact with Ghost saw his race ruined and it appeared after that the McLaren driver never got back on song. However he was quick and bolting on the softs near the end of the race, he achieved the fastest lap dipping into the 1:23's albeit finishing 2 laps down.<br /><br /><strong>9th - BreakerMorant - Ferrari</strong><br />Perhaps one to forget for the Ferrari sister car, an improved start to the championship was on the cards after toiling away last season for experience. Qualified 10th on the grid, and made solid ground on the much more experienced Lotus driver of Fredzfrog. However 9th is a solid result and a foundation on which to build on and 2 important points in constructors championship.<br /><br /><strong>DNF - Fredzfrog - Lotus</strong><br />A very disappointing start to the season for the number 2 lotus driver. Showed promise in the later rounds of season 3, and now has the experience, but yet to show it on the track. Melbourne suits the driver and a solid 9th in qualifying was a solid start, however 7th or higher wasn't out of reach. Finished 4 laps down. Will want to forget this race.<br /><br /><strong>Retired - st8smn350 - Red Bull</strong><br />Unfortunately poor reliability saw the Red Bull rookie unable to finish the race as his RB7 ground to a halt on lap 5 with lap issues. Something we hope will be rectified next week in Malaysia.<br /><br /><strong>Retired - NIGHTKID2 - Sauber</strong><br />The second of the retires, a blown engine unfortunately ended the second of the rookies race on lap 29. <br /><br /><strong>Qualifying Lap</strong><br />ET ROM - 1:22.960<br /><strong>Fastest Lap</strong><br />TurrbalTerror - 1:23.452</p>
<p><strong>Drive of the day</strong> is always a tough one, because naturally it's hard to past the winning driver.  While Flouncy put in a fantastic recovery driver to take the win, my driver of the day goes to ET Rom, off the back of a huge improvement since initial off season practice for season 4. </p>
<p>We can't always put in brilliant efforts all the time, so <strong>Donkey of the Race</strong> is awarded to the driver who most completely muffed his race up or muffed it up for others around him.  As with Driver of the Race, Donkey of the race considers where the driver should have finished had not he driven like such an ass.  While HolyGhost79's general lack of race pace and consistency as well as causing an accident on Lap 1 that interfered with a few drivers races, make him a candidate, TurrbalTerror wins the award for the following assine actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stalling coming out of the pits in qualifying</li>
<li>Crashing into HolyGhost79 on lap 1</li>
<li>Getting 3 drive through penalties</li>
<li>Breaking his nose on entry to the pitlane</li>
<li>Missing the pitlane on one attempt, when following Eradicator84</li>
</ul>
<p>All in light of setting the race fastest lap and nearly the pole time on prime tyres, makes him the biggest donkey of the race.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <race>63</race>
          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>A record number of 15 drivers lined up for the Malaysian qualifying and race for Season 4.  Following an unprecendent level of pre-race testing and information sharing between team mates, hopes for all drivers were running high.  The championship is fast become more than a quick race between a few like minded individuals.  Round 2 of Season 4 built on the foundations of a large field at Round 1, to make this a true event, and the tensions and intensity during the 28 lap reflected this.</p>
<p>As testing indicated, McLaren were going to have a fast car for this race, and they didn't disappoint.  bobaj0r secured his first pole position of the season and his first since Turkey Season 3, with a massive half second gap over Atomic Lambo.  The second row of the grid was occuppied by the other McLaren driver, TurrbalTerror, and HolyGhost79, driving for Lotus.</p>
<p>The surprise of qualifying was double world champion and season 4 points leader Flouncy who started in his lowest grid position ever, sixth place, 1 behind the Mercedes of ET Rom.</p>
<p>With such a shake up of the grid, the race was looking to be very interesting and held the lure of turning the pionts table upside down.  A the grid got away and the front runners engaged their KERS to clear the pack, a fast starting Flouncy stuck his nose of the inside of 5th place only to be struck from behind, being sent into multiple spins before being hit again by two more cars.  Flouncy's scream through the team radio evident of the high tensions this event was producing and that even after two titles, his motivation to win is as high as ever.  Something he'd need from 13th position.</p>
<p>No such bad luch fell bobaj0r, who on option tyres pulled away from the pack as if they were standing still, with pace no one, not even Atomic Lambo had answer for.  As the field settled down, the front pack looked like: bobaj0r, Atomic Lambo, ET Rom, TurrbalTerror, and HolyGhost79, with the pack spreading out as every lap passed.  The first battle, between ET Rom, TurrbalTerror, and HolyGhost79 was hard fought right up until the first round of pitstops, where TurrbalTerror and then a lap later ET Rom pitted, leaving HolyGhost79 with a few laps of trouble free running.</p>
<p>As this battle warred on Flouncy was quietly making his way up through the pack.</p>
<p>Once the first round of pitstops had been completed by all runners, the front still looked the same, with bobaj0r holding a comfortable lead over Atomic Lambo, and then a gap back to the battle for 4way battle for third between HolyGhost79, Eradicator84, ET Rom and TurrbalTerror.  This remained the front pack battle for the majority of the race, with only HolyGhosts79's contact of his front right with TurrbalTerror's left rear on turn 14, which put him into a spin, allowing TurrbalTerror to consolidate the final podium position. </p>
<p>McLaren take constructors honours, with 1st and 3rd places, boosting them up to 2nd place in constructors, with Atomic Lambo leading the title after two 2nd place finishes.</p>
<p>There were a number of incidents through out the race, the most notorius driver being NIGHTKID2.  While he managed to keep out of the way on a number of occasions, a few incidents when in the proximity of more experienced drivers, particularly Flouncy cost other competitors important race points.  Another contender for <strong>Donkey of the Race</strong> was Eradicator84, who otherwise had a good race, until he overtook HolyGhost79 on the inside of turn 15 on his way to an immediate pitstop.  Shooting up the inside of HolyGhost79 and then across the race track rather than left and up the inside down the straight cause a collision that sent HolyGhost79 into a spin and slide across the grass.</p>
<p><strong>Drive of the Race</strong> definitely goes to bobaj0r.  A dominating qualifying laying the foundation for untouchable race pace, with only one spin coming out of the pits on cold primes after his first stop, marring what would otherwise be a perfect record.</p>
<h2>How they fared</h2>
<p><strong>1st - bobaj0r - McLaren</strong><br />Completely dominated the round from start to finish. A stunning qualifying lap some 4 tenths faster than the Renault of Lambo. Pulled away at the start of the race and never looked back. Had a small scare after the first set of pit stops, but never looked like giving the win away, in the end comfortably pulling away and finishing a good 25 seconds in front of Lambo. Definitely the drive of the round.<br /><br /><strong>2nd - Lambo - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />Another solid drive from the number one at Renault. Solid pace in qualifying, but just didn't quite have the speed in the race to challenge the McLaren of bobaj0r. Stayed out of trouble and didn't put a foot wrong. Had a nice tangle with ghost after the second pits but realistically the Lotus was on a different strategy. Finished 25+ seconds down, but 20 odd in front of the next McLaren. Renault go into China full of confidence and suddenly leading both the drivers and constructors.<br /><br /><strong>3rd - TurrbalTerror - McLaren</strong><br />Solid race, but slightly off the pace in qualifying after encouraging times set in practice, the McLaren driver spent alot of time dicing with the Lotus of HOLYGHOST79 and the Mercedes of ET ROM which most likely compromised his race in chasing after the Renault of Lambo. However solid points and critical for the drivers and constructors championship. <br /><br /><strong>4th - HOLYGHOST79 - Lotus</strong><br />Showed decent pace in the race, but a number of mistakes and accidents proved to halt his charge for what looked like a possible podium. Went against the pattern in terms of tire strategy opting to qualify on primes rather than options. Spent some time behind the McLaren of TurrbalTerror and showed good pace despite being on the harder tire. However mistakes cost Ghost and a spin after tagging the back of the McLaren of TurrbalTerror caused a spin losing a place and any chance of a podium. Several laps later another incident with the Torro Rosso of Fredzfrog resulted in loosing an en-plate. Much improved over Melbourne, however will want to work on building some confidence and consistency. Looking for more from the Lotus driver in China.<br /><br /><strong>5th - ET ROM au - Mercedes</strong><br />After a solid podium at Melbourne the Mercedes driver would be looking to build on his promising start to the season. Qualifying he was slightly off the front row times, but had excellent pace come race. Had a great start shooting up to third by the first corner, but was slowly reeled in by the better pace of the McLaren of TurrbalTerror. Diced with Ghost for a few laps but all things considering 5th was a good result and he'll be looking to build on that for China. Goes into china only 6 points behind Flouncy so will want to look at challenging the front runners soon.<br /><br /><strong>6th - Eradicator84 - Williams</strong><br />Slowly getting back into rythm after a season hiatus, the Williams driver would want to look at building on his relatively solid start to the season. Other than a small tangle with Ghost when trying to enter the pits during his 2nd pit, the Williams driver kept mostly to himself and put in a solid result. After qualifying 7th just behind the Ferrari of Flouncy, he was able to gain a place and actually set decent laps. Will want to slowly work his way back up the grid.<br /><br /><strong>7th - Flouncy - Ferrari</strong><br />His worst result to date and one that the two time champion will want to forget. Had a horrid time in qualifying with issues despite solid practice pace and lost out badly at the start being tagged multiple times dropping him well down the order. Suffered a puncture before his first stop and at the worst place on the track just after the pit entrance. Despite the horrid weekend, he only lies 5 points off Lambo and with China a happy hunting ground will look to bounce back.<br /><br /><strong>8th - CruiserComet - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />Another solid race from the quickly improving Renault driver. Didn't have the best qualifying, setting a time some 8 seconds off the pace, however his race pace was good and was able to jump both roxas and notjedi and score 2 important points. Will want to build on that for China to help Renault in the constructors championship.<br /><br /><strong>9th - roxas3sora3 - Williams</strong><br />Slightly disappointing race for the Williams driver. Set a good time in qualifying to put the Williams right behind the sister car in 8th on the grid. Lost out to CruiserComet in the end however he showed the Willaims had good pace setting a 1:32 which was two seconds faster than the Renault, however inconsistency was a problem, but still promising improvements. Will want to be challenging the mid field at China.<br /><br /><strong>10th - BreakerMorant - Ferrari</strong><br />Second consecutive points finish, all be it a few laps down and one place worse then Melbourne. However sometimes finishing the race is more important and he's shown clear improvement slowly getting faster and faster over the race distance. Will want to translate this slow rise in performance with more solid points to help Ferrari in the constructors race. <br /><br /><strong>11th - Fredzfrog - Lotus</strong><br />Just finishing out side the points again Fredzfrog can be slightly disappointed being beaten out by the much less experienced BreakerMorant. A lack of pre-race practice was telling with the Lotus driver only slightly in front of the second Ferrari. A miss understanding with the Lotus of Ghost the most interesting aspect of the race. Actually set a better fast lap then the 2nd Ferrari but couldn't be consistent.<br /><br /><strong>12th - NIGHTKID2 - Sauber</strong><br />Another driver setting a faster lap in race than in qualifying. Finished a few laps down, and at times had trouble negotiating the blue flags, but overall experience is important and after not finishing at all in Melbourne will want to build and grow on this experience.<br /><br /><strong>13th - st8smn350 - Red Bull</strong><br />Actually was close to the pace in qualifying with the back markers. Could have started as high as 11 with a cleaner lap. Was let down by issues which severely affected his race. Wasn't able to really challenge but did finish the race. More experience under the belt in which to build on.<br /><br /><strong>14th - notjedi - Red Bull</strong><br />Disappointing result considering his qualifying pace. Had all sorts of issues in race and will want to forget and move onto China.<br /><br /><strong>DNF - MaverickROM - Mercedes</strong><br />Was severely hindered by a lack of race preparation which was telling setting the slowest qualifying time that was not in relation to the drivers talent. Will want to forget this round and focus on a better preparation for China.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <race>64</race>
          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai saw our third winner from three races this season.  The qualifying session was wet, neutralising the raw pace the McLarens were expected to have over a single lap.  What we saw instead was our first wet session of the season and a Flouncy pole position be nearly half a second. </p>
<p>The top qualifiers were separated by 1 second from 1st down to fifth, with bobaj0r lining up in fifth place, 0.4s behind his McLaren teammate, who had run out of fuel near the end of his hot lap, preventing would could have been pole position.  The rest of the grid was evenly spaced out down to 12th position, with the 13th place getter and new comer, Modz85, being disqualified for leaving the track early.</p>
<p>Race day was cloudy but with 8% chance of rain, the rain held off for the entire race and we were blessed with a great race a dominant performance by Lambo, who after 2 second places in the last 2 races, improved his position one more to reach the top step of the podium. </p>
<p>Off the line, Atomic Lambo and Flouncy got off well and pushed each other hard, opening a small gap over HolyGhost79 who was being hounded by the two McLaren boys, running nose to tail.  After trying to pass HolyGhost79 for 4 laps, TurrbalTerror moved over for this teammate to have a shot, and on lap 7 he pitted for new Primes tires.  On Lap 8 bobaj0r got by HolyGhost79 for second, after Flouncy spun back to fourth at turn 3 lap 7.</p>
<p>Some of the great battles on track this race:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Lambo v Flouncy</li>
<li>HolyGhost79 v TurrbalTerror</li>
<li>HolyGhost79 v bobajor</li>
<li>Flouncy v TurrbalTerror</li>
<li>ET Rom v TurrbalTerror</li>
<li>CruiserComent v roxas3sora3</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1st - Lambo - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />Completely dominated the race from start to finish. Qualifying was tricky with the wet conditions with the top 3 only separated by only 4 tenths of a second, however a fantastic start saw the Renault jump Ghost at the start and then pass the Ferrari on the back straight before the end of the first lap. From then on showed great pace and made a two stop strategy work well. Highly deserved his first race win of season 4.<br /><br /><strong>2nd - bobaj0r - McLaren</strong><br />Another solid drive from the Mclaren driver. A great recovery from 5th on the grid with the only error choosing a double prime tire strategy. Could have challenged for the win otherwise. Tangled with Ghost for many laps and showed good pace during the last stint however just ran out of laps. In dangerous looking form and with the Championship leader absent for the next round in Istanbul, we could be see a new championship leader next round.<br /><br /><strong>3rd - Flouncy - Ferrari</strong><br />Will consider this a disappointing race despite a spirited fight back to steal 3rd place from the Lotus of Ghost. Was amongst the favourites for this race with blistering pace set during pre-practice sessions and when he put the Ferrari on pole in wet and difficult conditions, the race win seems likely. However a slow start and a mistake on lap 4 he never was able to get on song and was well off the pace. The hot favourite at the start of the year now sees himself 15 points off the Renault. However with lots of racing left and the absence of Lambo in the next round we could still see some surprises.<br /><br /><strong>4th - HOLYGHOST79 - Lotus</strong><br />Lotus will walk away from this race knowing that a botched tire strategy cost them a likely podium. The Lotus started with an aggressive race approach starting on the prime tire after qualifying 2nd in the wet conditions. However lost out badly at the start being passed quickly by Lambo and bobaj0r. Spent alot of time battling bobaj0r and pitted very early on lap 11 for option tires with 17 laps to go. Eventually had to pit again on lap 22 for another set of option tires losing out to Ben but comfortably ahead of ET ROM au. Will rue an opportunity lost and will desperately want a good result in Istanbul to get his season back on track.<br /><br /><strong>5th - ET ROM au - Mercedes</strong><br />His second consecutive 5th place was one of slight frustration. Slightly off the pace in both qualifying and in the race it looked unlikely the Mercedes was going to challenge the front runners, but with plenty of points to play for in the constructors an important result nevertheless. Stayed pretty much out of trouble only making one or two mistakes and was able to capitalise on TurrbalTerrors spin but will want to try and regain some of that early season form. <br /><br /><strong>6th - TurrbalTerror - McLaren</strong><br />Solid race, but no doubt will be slightly disappointed that he wasn't challenging for a podium. Showed excellent pace during practice especially one runs on the prime tire. Qualified fourth in difficult conditions and had good battles with Flouncy and Ghost. However a mistake on Lap 20 with a spin that resulted in a damaged nose cost him points as the McLaren pitted for a new nose and lost a place to ET ROM. Set the fastest lap which is a small consolation, but will want to be challenging for podiums again in the next race to get his title challenge going and with McLaren only 7 points off in the constructors race.<br /><br /><strong>7th - NightKid2 - Sauber</strong><br />The new rookie backed up his best qualifying performance with his first Atomic F1 points and finished a respectable 8th. Slowly on the improvement, will want to build on this experience and chase down Williams in the constructors race.<br /><br /><strong>8th - CruiserComet - Lotus-Renault</strong><br />Another solid race from the quickly improving Renault driver. Very respectable in qualifying will want to start challenging the mid field runners to help in the constructors battle.<br /><br /><strong>9th - roxas3sora3 - Williams</strong><br />Slightly disappointing race for the Williams driver. Set a good time in qualifying especially in difficult conditions. Lost out to CruiserComet in the end but lacked some race pace in the end being some 4 seconds off the pace, however finished much higher then his highly rated team-mate. Will want to be back challenging the mid field at Istanbul.<br /><br /><strong>10th - BreakerMorant - Ferrari</strong><br />Three consecutive points finish, all be it a few laps down and one place worse then Melbourne. China was clearly not his best track and surprisingly set the same qualifying time in the wet as he did in race. Plenty to work on from here, but will want to try and start moving up the order to secure more points for the constructors championship.<br /><br /><strong>11th - st8smn350 - Red Bull</strong><br />Slowly on the improvement and just out of the points, unfortunately spent much of the race letting faster cars through. Is slowly finding his feat and with more practice will want to start challenging the the saubers.<br /><br /><strong>12th - Eradicator84 - Williams</strong><br />Little was heard or seen of the Williams driver. Probably a compromised race preparation. Should have been much high up the grid and will want to improve before next weekends race.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <race>65</race>
          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Increasing intensity at Turkey saw a dramatic grid and a close race, depsite the points leader, Atomic Lambo, missing the round.</p>
<p>Pole position went to bobaj0r, with TurrbalTerror in the sister McLaren in second place, six hundredths back. There was a 0.3 second gap to third but first through to fifth were seperated by only a second.  NightKid2 put in a stellar performance to be 0.7s off the pace in fifth place.  An impressive effort.</p>
<p>Race day saw a 9% chance of rain, with cloudy skies.  As most of the field got away, except for a bogged down TurrbalTerror, doing his best Mark Webber impersonation, Flouncy found the holeshot and took it spearing from 4th into the race lead, as the dramatic onboard footage from TurrbalTerror shows.  Turn one wasn't without further incident though as NightKid2 also looked to capitalise and optimistically tried to go three wide through turn one, between TurrbalTerror on the inside and Eradicator84 on the outside.  The move was never going to stick and while TurrbalTerror and Eradicator84 both gave the hard-charger room, he touched TurrbalTerror and spun, to be collected by BreakerMorant.</p>
<p>Flouncy, bobaj0r, and Eradicator84 pulled a mini gap over TurrbalTerror, ET ROM, HolyGhost79, and the improving roxas3sora3, as TurrbalTerror struggled through turn 8.  By the last few corners of the track, TurrbalTerror had caught them back again and was attempting to pass Flouncy.  A KERS assisted move he later pulled off on the exit of the final turn. </p>
<p>The two battled closely for the next few laps, as ET Rom and HolyGhost79 started to back up behind them, a train forming.  TurrbalTerror pulled left to look for a gap to pass Flouncy on the inside of turn 1, and thought better of it pulling back in behind him.  It was enough to break the rythm and ET Rom tapped TurrbalTerror into the turn, and Flouncy was away down the track.</p>
<p>TurrablTerror, ET Rom, with HolyGhost79 sitting patient behind, then battled it out, ET Rom getting past when TurrbalTerror braked earlier than the following car expected and was pushed offline.  A few laps later, on lap 6 ET ROM spun on the exit of turn 7 and speared across the nose of TurrbalTerror, luckily not taking them both out but certainly ruining ET Rom's chance of a podium, when he showed good speed.  With that collision HolyGhost79 made a clean pass on both of them and never looked back.</p>
<p>At the first round of pitstops the two McLarens were queued in the pits, losing TurrbalTerror further time as he waited for his tires to be brought out.  McLaren have since evaluated their pit stop protocols and have promised to communicate better in future races.</p>
<p>Up front bobaj0r and Eradicator84 were dicing it out when bobaj0r's wheel came off, resulting in a spin, from which he would recover.</p>
<p>Further down the pack NightKid2 was recovering strongly and roxas3sora3 was putting in a solid drive, well into the midfield battle between ET Rom and TurrbalTerror.  Although his ECU did seem to be running in fuel conservation mode, which would explain his atrocious lack of top speed, making him a sitting duck on down the straights.</p>
<p>ET Roms' spinning activities were far from over after the first incident, after racing incidents with roxas3sora3 sent him into a spin and a far to optimistic attempt by NightKid2 also pushed him off, as it looked like the later driver attempted to drive right through him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>bobaj0r<br /></strong>Another dominant drive from the Brisbane based driver, leading from pole position and fighting back after his wheel fell off. Also setting fastest race lap toward the end of the race.</p>
<p><strong>Eradicator84<br /></strong>Drove an extremely strong race from third on the grid into second place, pushing bobaj0r hard all the way.</p>
<p><strong>HolyGhost79<br /></strong>Despite connection performance problems forcing him to adjust his style, he implemented a prime tires first strategy that paid off, allowing an error free drive from 7th to 3rd</p>
<p><strong>Flouncy<br /></strong>The double champion again didn't seem to have the ultimate pace but made up for a qualifying result that was lower than he expected by having the best start of the year, fourth to first on the first corner.  He may have been able to achieve more if not battling it out with TurrbalTerror for the opening laps.</p>
<p><strong>TurrbalTerror<br /></strong>Qualified well but made a miserable start and was bullied around for the first few laps.   Lacked the ultimate pace of the front runners, despite running the same setup as bobaj0r.  Lost the most places in the race, dropping from 2nd to 5th by race end.  His fastest lap, nearly a full second slower than his teammate and a few others indicated his lack of race pace.</p>
<p><strong>NightKid2<br /></strong>Put in a solid qualifying performance, his best to date, but overly optimistic passing moves cost him and the cars he was involved with.  When he learns how to race in close promixity with others, he'll be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p><strong>ET Rom_au<br /></strong>Qualified nearly two seconds off the pace but put in a stronger race effort than his pace indicated.  Battled with TurrbalTerror for a good portion of the race.  Mistakes and collisions, some his own fault, some no fault of his own cost him time and race results.</p>
<p><strong>roxas3sora3<br /></strong>Race results did not justly reward his performance.  Drove one of his best races to date, battling well with those around him.  Race fastest lap was only a tenth slower than his qualifying lap, showing he improved as he drove on.  Wrong fuel setting cost him performance and results.  He performed admirably for Williams and will be looking to step it up for Spain in a weeks time.</p>
<p><strong>CruiserComet</strong><br />Lagging issues hampered his performance but he kept his nose clean and brought the car home in the points.  A poor weekend for Renault and he no doubt missed his team leaders influence.</p>
<p><strong>BreakerMorant</strong><br />Drove a solid race but finished where he started.  While his results may not reflect it, his race performances are improving and Ferrari have more to look forward to in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Fredzfrog<br /></strong>Another driver who put in a solid effort. Fredzfrog continues to inspire underdogs around the world with his determined drives despite lack of pace.  He avoided faster cars without fuss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Drive of the Race</strong>: It's hard to go past bobaj0r, but drive of the race goes to Eradicator84 for pushing the McLaren hard and making up places on his start position</p>]]></bodyText>

          <race>66</race>
          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Round 5 at the Catalunya circuit in Spainish city of Barcelona saw the McLarens lock out the front row of the grid for the second race in succession.  TurrbalTerror held provisional pole for a good part of the session until bobaj0r eclipsed the time by a few hundredths, a simlar margin to last weekends Turkish Grand Prix.  The surprise result was Atomic Lambo back in fifth position, although this may have been better if the qualifying session hadn't been restarted.</p>
<p>When the race eventually started, the McLarens made a clean getaway at the front, both utilising the KERS get away quick, with TurrbalTerror riding bobaj0r's gearbox before backing off to avoid any potential first corner incidents, to be immediately swamped by a hard charge Atomic Lambo, with massive top end speed, Eradicator84, ET_Rom and an opportunistic Flouncy, making the most of the first corner melee.</p>
<p><strong>1st - bobaj0r - McLaren<br /></strong>Drove a clean race from pole position after narrowly beating his teammate.  Was troubled initially by Flouncy but able to capitalise on small mistake by the Ferrari driver.  He was kept honest by Atomic Lambo and Flouncy.</p>
<p>There's no question now that bobaj0r is the real deal. Another controlled and dominating drive from the McLaren driver he may have only pipped his team mate to pole by only a few hundredths of a second but from the get go he was unstoppable. He handled the pressure from Ferrari's Flouncy on the opening laps, and when he came out of the pits on his last stint just in front of Lambo controlled his pace while his tires came up to temp and drove away from the pack. If it looked easy from the cockpit it's probably because it was. Three wins now from four starts and a worst of second the McLaren driver is riding a wave of confidence that boads well for him going into the next race and a loud warning to his rivals. Will look to set records now and join a select group of drivers that have one three consecutive races.</p>
<p><strong>2nd - Atomic Lambo - Renault<br /></strong>His job was made harder by starting from fifth on the grid but was able to power past a few cars before turn 1.  Survived a messy first lap to finish the lap in 3rd place.  Ran an option, option, prime strategy to try and close down bobaj0r.  He ran the McLaren driver close in the final stages.</p>
<p>Not the easiest weekend for the Renault driver, he suffering from traffic in qualifying and only managed to put his Renault 5th on the grid. Pre-race testing suggested pole was on the cards however he had an excellent start on the grippy side of the grid and worked his way up to 2nd before the first corner. However lost out badly slipping to 7th at one stage during the opening corners. He recovered will before the end of the first lap to get back to third after a stunning double pass on the straight however by then the leaders were several seconds down the road. Switched to an alternative strategy to try and leap frog the Ferrari in the pits, and almost managed to do the same to the McLaren. However 2nd and some solid points, and with more favoured tracks coming up, Lambo is in a good position to challenge bobaj0r.</p>
<p><strong>3rd - Flouncy - Ferrari</strong><br />Made a good start, getting the holeshot at the first corner and taking second place.  Flouncy lacked outright pace for the race win and was challenged by the second McLaren of TurrbalTerror for third, before fuel delivery problems for the McLaren #2 saw him drop off.</p>
<p>Challenged the McLaren during the opening laps but a small mistake and quickly degrading tires saw him fall back as the Renault of Lambo caught up with him. Will rue staying out too long during his first stint as the Renault jumped him in the pits. Relatively strong drive he held off a fast finishing TurrbalTerror in the sister McLaren to round out the podium. A strong result considering the last race in Istanbul but will be disappointed it wasn't at least another step higher. He'll be buoyed by the good pace he showed in practice and will want to carry that over to Monaco, a place that he has won at before.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>4th - HolyGhost79 - Lotus<br /></strong>Yet another solid drive from the Lotus leader.  He started from the back of the pack after not participating in qualify, fearing a break in the space-time continuum, but climbed up through the field. Capitalised on the misfortune a few in front to secure a solid fourth place. </p>
<p>Strangely didn't set a time in qualifying, opting to save his tires for the race and started from 12th on the grid. Drove a fairly conservative race and kept mainly out of trouble. Was fortunate to steal 4th with TurrbalTerrors refuelling issues, but nevertheless a good drive and hopefully plenty of positives to take into Monaco.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>5th - ET ROM au - Mercedes<br /></strong>Qualified well, in fourth, and made a good start but was tagged by NightKid2, placing him to the back of the pack.  Climbed up the field with a consistent drive, but was tagged and spun again by NightKid2.  Lacked outright pace to challenge for the win, but would have made fourth spot if not for the incidents.</p>
<p>Unfortunate not to be higher, the Mercedes driver was competitive all weekend and after putting his car on the second row of the grid. Made a decent start but was caught up in the mayhem of turn 10 with contact with NightKid2. Tangled with him later again in the race and dropped further down the pack. Will take some consolidation in the fact that the Sauber driver was penalised a race for this conduct but will be overall disappointed with what could have been a top 4 or more drive.</p>
<p><strong>6th - NightKid2 - Sauber<br /></strong>Qualified well but was given a 10 place penalty forcing him to start from the back.  Drove an aggressive race and made good places up at the opening lap, but frequent mistakes hurt his overall performance.  He set the fastest lap on his way to his best result of the season.  Unfortunately he also earned a one race suspension on the grounds of continued aggressive driving.</p>
<p>Was the centre of a number of controversial passes and moves which in the end cost him a grid spot in this weeks Monaco GP. Despite being extreamly quick and setting the faster lap in race the Sauber driver tangled with a number of other drivers leading to the governing body and stewards to disqualify him from the next race. Showed great single lap pace, but needs to combine that with patience and racecraft that is sure to come with experience.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>7th - TurrbalTerror - McLaren<br /></strong>Again qualified well, in second place, hundredths off pole.  Had another poor start after getting off the line.  Received a drive through penalty for an illegal overtake on turn 7 of lap 1, after putting a wheel on the grass when passing Eradicator84.  Drove well from the back of the grid to be up to fourth by lap 12 and into third by lap 26 and getting to within 10 seconds of the leader.  Ran out of fuel 1 lap before the end, dropping him from a clear fourth to seventh.</p>
<p>Had the pace to challenge for the win, all be it if it wasn't for a drive through penalty received during the opening lap. Some say warranted but it could be easily argued that it was quite harsh. However in testament to his character he kept his cool and put in a great drive to work his way back through the field to almost snatch 3rd from the Ferrari of Flouncy. However a fual management issue caused him to lose a number of places as the McLaren crawled around the track for the last lap and a half. A weekend to forget.</p>
<p><strong>8th - roxas3sora3 - Virgin<br /></strong>Drove a quiet race from 8th on the grid, into 8th position when the flag fell.  Never had the podium challenging pace, but none-the-less drove a solid race.</p>
<p>Will be slightly disappointed with the result but showed strong race pace. Remained relatively out of trouble and showed some good consistent pace. Will want to score strongly in Monaco to ensure he stays in front of the second Renault and stay within striking distance of the much improved Williams.</p>
<p><strong>9th - BreakerMorant - Ferrari<br /></strong>The veteran of the field once again put in a points scoring drive, rising from 10th to 9th, albiet 3 laps down, and giving Ferrari a few more precious points.</p>
<p>Was well off the times during qualifying but found a better pace during the race. Lost alot of time getting out of the way to blue flags but overall an ok race for the Ferrari driver. Will need to make sure that he's scoring more points in Monaco as Ferrari slip further behind Renault and McLaren.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - st8smn350<br /></strong>Qualified in 11th and car troubles forces his retirement before he had a chance to show his potential.  Would have been inline for a points finish today.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - Eradicator84<br /></strong>Drove assertively off the line and into 2nd place for a brief instant before third.  Got tagged by ET rom and NightKid on turn 5 of lap 1, and by TurrbalTerror on turn 6.  Lacked ultimate pace to lead the mid-field.  Officials disqualified him for reasons unknown.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - Fredzfrog</strong><br />Qualified in the top 10 but failed to make the race start.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - Modz85</strong><br />Again let down by equipment problems and failed to set a qualifying time or join the race.  Hopefully his car is in better shape for the Monaco grand prix next week.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <race>67</race>
          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The Monaco Atomic F1 Grand Prix was never going to dissapoint.  The field got a taste of what to expect in the race with a half completed "warm up" qualifying session which saw Atomic Lambo go fastest on a 1:09.9, but not all the fastest drviers had set a time.  The dropout of Eradicator84 caused a restart, although he was later to drop out again in the following qualifying session.</p>
<p>Once the final qualifying session opened, so did the heavens and we had what all the drivers feared, a wet tract at Monaco.  Atomic Lambo set the fastest lap, followed by bobaj0r and TurrbalTerror, the Lotus Renault breaking the run of front row lock-outs the McLaren have recently been enjoying.</p>
<p><strong>1st - HolyGhost79</strong> <strong>- Team Lotus</strong><br />In an event that we won't see again for long while, HolyGhost79 took advantage of the misfortune of bobaj0r and Atomic Lambo to cut his way through the grid, from last place, in a near faultless drive.<strong>﻿</strong></p>
<p><strong>2nd - Flouncy - Ferrari<br /></strong>The rain didn't suit the double world champion as lined up 4th on the grid, some 2.1 seconds back from the pole. He battled hard with TurrbalTerror on a few occasions, and ran through the pits more than he needed to after damaging front wings.  Had he qualified in front of TurrbalTerror he may have had the pace for the race win.</p>
<p><strong>3rd - TurrbalTerror - McLaren<br /></strong>Finished where he started, just without the two drives in front he expected.  Drove a decent race to lead from lap 8 to lap 25 when built up a 20 second lead to 2nd place.  Was spun on the first lap by Flouncy which cost him 12 seconds.  Had a few problems with backmarkers at critical moments and slightly damaged the front wing a few times, spending 50% of the managing a damaging nose.  Finished about where he expected.</p>
<p><strong>4th - bobaj0r - ﻿McLaren<br /></strong>Finishing behind his teammate for the first time this season, bobajor had  race he'd rather forget but still managed a fourth position.  He was spun on the first lap after a tap from Atomic Lambo, resulting in a radio outburst we haven't heard since ET Rom in Turkey last week.  He was recovering well before suffering a puncture not long after his 2nd pitstop.  Gutted to have finished in his worst position fo the year and will be champing at the bit to prove he can do it at his bogey track in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>5th - ET ROM au - Mercedes<br /></strong>Had a quiet race meet on his way to 5th place after being lapped by the leaders.  He'll be wanting to increase his pace on Montreal although he finished as first of the rest and probably finished higher than he would have if not for Atomic Lambo's retirement.</p>
<p><strong>6th - Modz85 - Sauber<br /></strong>Finally his car managed to not let him down the qualify sessions and Modz joined for his first complete race with Atomic F1.  He qualified a fantastic 5th considering his rookie status and brought it home in 6th place albiet a lap down.  His performance was solid and drove enough to keep out of the eye of the stewards.</p>
<p><strong>7th - st8smn350 - Toros Rosso<br /></strong>Finished in his best position yet and performed admirably pace wise ﻿with a solid race fastest lap time.  Is starting to show some of the pre-season form he had prior to his disconnection problems. st8smn350 will be looking forward to a further improved positions in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>8th - roxas3sora3 - Williams</strong><br />Following the loss of his teammate it was up to sora3 to bring it home for the team from Grove.  Only making up one place from the grid, he'll be wanting to up his speed and establish himself as a front running midrunner.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - Atomic Lambo - Lotus Renault<br /></strong>A race Lambo will definitely want to forget, when a race win was lost to him through now fault of his own.  Lambo pressed on after a turn 1 incident with bobaj0r and capitalised on the TurrbalTerror and Flouncy contact as they battled for second place, allowing his lead to instantly jump to 13.5 seconds by the end of the second lap.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - CruiserComent - Lotus Renault<br /></strong>Really not a race that Lotus Renault want to revisit.  Battling with intermittent connection problems, he lost his front wing when bobaj0r passed and it was enough to force him to park the car.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - FredzFrogz - Toro Rosso<br /></strong>Another race to forget for Fredzfrogz.  Car problems caused his early retirement but he struggled for pace in all sessions.﻿</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Canada was expected to be a closely faught affair between bobaj0r and Atomic Lambo, and in the end, that's exactly what it was.</p>
<p>Pole position went to bobaj0r with a fine drive, to beat Atomic Lambo by 0.2 seconds, with TurrbalTerror and Flouncy the other drivers to go under 70 seconds.  That was after the qualifying restart caused by FredzFrogz being disqualified for heavily crashing in game (as opposed to his computer crashing).</p>
<p>The race got underway with bobaj0r falling victim to a tyre bug that robbed him of all grip from the start of the race.  The other McLaren of TurrbalTerror also got punted off track by a blinking car and suddenly both McLarens were back of the pack.  Fortunately for them, but less fortunate for race leader Atomic Lambo, half the field suffered disconnection problems and the race was restarted, this time with a random grid.</p>
<p>The restart saw roxas3sora3 in pole, with HolyGhost79 and fredzfrog up the front too.  The McLarens lined up 5th and 6th with Atomic Lambo and Flouncy further toward the back of the pack.  Leggards pick had his race work cut out of him if he was to be victorious.</p>
<p>The start was a bit messy but after a few laps bobaj0r was in the lead and TurrbalTerror in second place, albiet with a broken wing.  Fast rising through the pack was Atomic Lambo and Flouncy. Before the first round of stops the Renault driver had the McLaren number 2 and was darting back and forward looking for a way past.  With team orders in full swing the McLaren driver made his car about 2 track widths wide as he struggled with a very pacey Atomic Lambo and a broken front wing on his own car.  Try as Atomic Lambo might, he uncharacteriscally got the gearing wrong and lacked the pace down the main back straight.  TurrbalTerror only had to save his KERS for that part of the circuit and the Renault had no answer. And save his KERS he did.  Eventually the first round of stops came and TurrbalTerror dived into the pits, giving Atomic Lambo a chance to build a gap before he too had to pit. </p>
<p>Flash forward toward the end of the race and Atomic Lambo passed for the lead with only a few laps remaining.  It was close but again his lack of top end speed let him down as bobaj0r got a bite of KERS and DRS to breeze by the Renault driver on the last corner of the race. </p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The first race with Patch 2 for F1 2011 and things did not go smoothly.  Mainly the enhancements to the networking code made the racing worst. Initial testing with a few players was good, but with 13, it didn't go so well and as soon as anyone spoke everyone suffered massive frame rate drop that made the cars undriveable.  The race was restarted with everyone muting everyone else.</p>
<p>bobaj0r led from pole, followed by Flouncy, Modz85 and TurrbalTerror. A collision at turn 1 caused by ET Rom put Flouncy and Modz out of the running and opened a gap for Atomic Lambo to take second place, from fifth on the grid.  The race was eventually won by bobaj0r, who for the most part kept his nose clean while others faltered, allowing him to build a lead that could not be lost.</p>
<p><strong>1st - bobaj0r<br /></strong>Drove another near error free race, nearly lost 1st place to the faster at the sister McLaren, but defended strategically.  The win was all but sealed when TurrbalTerror lost the rear-end on lap 18 and received a drive through.</p>
<p><strong>2nd - TurrbalTerror<br /></strong>Drove hard to take 2nd place and might have won if not for a few slips, some of his own doing and some by others.  Had clear pace over the non-Mclaren cars and made the best of Flouncy being mid-field.</p>
<p><strong>3rd - Atomic Lambo<br /></strong>Unfortunate not to have finished in second place, losing out halfway along the last lap and coming to a near halt, or so it would seem.  Battled hard and probably had a few mistakes that kept him down.</p>
<p><strong>4th - HolyGhost79<br /></strong>Started near the back of the pack but like Monaco made good ground again when accidents happened further up the order.  Lacked outright pace to challenge for the podium but must be satisfied with the fourth place. It could have been worse.</p>
<p><strong>5th - Eradicator84</strong><br />Drove a good race, challenging for the top spots early on but also lacked overall pace, his fastest lap 2.6 seconds off.</p>
<p><strong>6th - Flouncy<br /></strong>Had plenty to be optimistic about on the grid, with a solid second place start.  Was punted off track early and never recovered.  From there he couldn't show his true pace, or avoid further incidents.</p>
<p><strong>7th - Modz85<br /></strong>Started 3rd but was effected by first lap drama.  The game seemed to place him at a different place on the track to what others saw.  Set the fourth fastest race lap. A good effort.</p>
<p><strong>8th - ET Rom<br /></strong>Not as good as it could have been, ET never showed fantastic pace and finished consistent with his overall race fastest lap.  Involved in an unneccessary incident on lap 1.</p>
<p><strong>9th - roxas3sora3<br /></strong>Showed good pace in friday practice but was unable to convert that to the race pace of this teammate. </p>
<p><strong>10th - st8smn350<br /></strong>Had a quiet race off the radar, but getting out of the way of others when it counted.  It is expected that a lack of practice accounted for the low pace.</p>
<p><strong>DSQ - NightKid2, BreakerMorant, CruiserComet (Connections)<br /></strong></p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Round 9 of season four was a closely contested affair, perhaps the closest all year.  Bobaj0r once again sat on pole position after Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror couldn't replicate their practice speed and also dip into the 1:26's.</p>
<p>The start saw bobaj0r and Atomic Lambo lead with a gap over about 1 second over TurrbalTerror.  Lambo got by with a move up the inside into Brooklands, which became his preffered passing place during the race, taking the lead there two more times. After the first round of pitstops on lap 6, when Lambo and bobaj0r entered the pits together, the Mclaren team turned their car around faster and bobaj0r got back in the lead, only to lose it again a few corners later on cold tyres.  Meanwhile, TurrbalTerror who pitted a lap later to avoid car stacking in the McLaren pits came out right behind the two, but lost groud on cold tyres, falling as far back as 5.7 seconds before clawing back the gap</p>
<p>By the time the second round of pitstops came, Turrbal took the lead as Lambo and bobajor again pitted together.  This time, once TurrbalTerror had pitted he came out in front of the other podium contenders, before Lambo put a move on into Brooklands for first, and bobaj0r went by a corner later, while TurrbalTerror's tyres got up to temperature. </p>
<p>The gap was much less now and the trio circulated within a second of each other before bobaj0r put a move on Lambo coming into Stowe and TurrbalTerror took advantage of the failed attempt and snuck by into second, through his favourite passing point at Vale.</p>
<p>Again the trio circulated nose to tale and TurrbalTerror took advantage of the lapped Breaker Morant to again put it up the inside into Vale and took first from Atomic Lambo.  boba also passed for 3rd, as the contact between TurrbalTerror and Atomic Lambo gave opportunity. boba got the run on TurrbalTerror and took the lead of the race with a DRS pass up the straight leading to Brooklands.</p>
<p>A lap later boba experienced technical difficulties and both TurrbalTerror and Atomic Lambo got by.  The gap was now 3.5 seconds from TurrbalTerror in the lead back to Atomic Lambo then another 7 seconds back to bobaj0r, but both Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror were low on fuel and had to a conservative fuel mix, while bobaj0r was not, allowing him to claw back the gap. </p>
<p>On lap 25 of 26 TurrbalTerror ran completely out of fuel and gave the victory to Lambo, not before boaj0r had caught up to be within 1.5 seconds of the lead.  Eradticat84 eventually rounded out the podium some 35 seconds back, while a distraught TurrbalTerror idled through the last lap and half to finish 6th, the last of the non lapped cars.</p>
<p>The race was again a case of he who kept his nose the cleanest won, as mistakes and problems from both McLarens thwarted their chances.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Round 10 of Season 4, the German Grand Prix, was held at the Nurburgring this season, after being held at the Hockenhiemring for the previous 3 seasons. This presented an opportunity for the established drivers to assert themselves over their rivals, and for the new drivers to race on a level playing field, and it showed this weekend.</p>
<p>As drivers went out for qualifying it was clear the the top end hadn't changed, bobaj0r still set the fastest time, trailed by Lambo.  The surprise was TurrbalTerror, who was down in 6th position, having set his time on prime tyres.  Once out on options he was2md 0.09 seconds behind Lambo and in third position, despite being held up by NightKid2 for the entire sector 2 of his fast run.  ET ROM did extremely well to in fourth place, only half a second adrift of the established top three, with Flouncy rounding out the top 5.</p>
<p>The race loaded up wet and the during the load process Atomic Lambo dropped out.  It was decided that qualifying would be re-run when he returned.  Qualifying two got underway as a wet session and Lambo and TurrbalTerror immediately shot to the top.  Mid way through the session TurrbalTerror set his benchmark pole time, some 0.9 seconds up on 2nd, and retired to the garage for the rest of the session.  The rest of the field tried hard to match and some even going faster in sectors 1 and 3, but ultimate speed in sector 2 saw Turrbal keep the pole by 0.09s from Atomic Lambo.</p>
<p><img src="~/media/27859/2nd-quali-wet-germany_500x236.jpg"  width="500"  height="236" alt="2nd-quali-wet-germany.PNG" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p>
<p>The race got underway to dry conditions, with TurrbalTerror leading from pole, until a fast starting bobaj0r pushed him wide at turn 1 and the chasing group of Flouncy and Lambo bumped him off the road and spun him round on the second last turn of the lap.</p>
<p>The podium was filled with the usual suspects.</p>
<p><strong>1st - bobaj0r</strong><br />Drove a consistently fast race out front to lead unhindered from lap 1 until the end.  A deserved winner on this new track.  Also set fastest lap on the lap immediately after TurrbalTerrors fastest lap.  Once again the Mclarens were in a league of their own for outright speed.</p>
<p><strong>2nd - Atomic Lambo</strong><br />Had a less than perfect race driving through the pits with a broken wing after collision with Eradicator84, but still finished in a deserved 2nd place.  While not the perfect race he should be satisfied with a solid 2nd and best of the rest.</p>
<p><strong>3rd - TurrbalTerror<br /></strong>bobaj0r colliding with him on turn 1 put him back to 2nd.  Flouncy colliding with him at the end of lap 1 put him 9th.  He made up ground to 8th before HolyGhost79 lost it in front of him and put him into the wall on the last turn of turn lap 2, and back to 9th again.  Moved up to 7th before getting a drive through penalty when avoiding a sliding Flouncy by going over the curb on turn 7, dropping him back to 9th.  Ran in lean fuel for the first 10 laps. Pitted on lap 7 for primes and made them last until lap 20, when he pitted for options.  With fuel to spare and extra sticky tyres he charged up the field and secured third place with a second last lap pass on Eradicator84. </p>
<p><strong>4th - Eradicator84</strong><br />Drove a solid and consistent race and would have finished on the podium if not for increased pressure from TurrbalTerror in the final laps resulted in a spin as he out-braked himself into turn 13.  Had decent race pace with the 5th fastest lap.</p>
<p><strong>5th - Flouncy</strong><br />Great race potential was thwarted by the lap 1 touch on TurrbalTerror resulting in a drive through penalty, dropping him down to 7th.  Battled with st8smn350 on lap 3 and spun, losing more ground, but was able to make it back up through the pack somewhat.  He'll want more practice ahead of the Hungoraring if he's to place on the podium.</p>
<p><strong>6th - ET Rom au</strong><br />Equalified an impressive fourth and showed competitive race times to finish despite finishing in 6th, the best of the non-race winners. ET Rom is making good progress up the grid and more consistent performances, like this, will help him.</p>
<p><strong>7th - NightKid2<br /></strong>The much maligned Sauber driver was again in the wars from a number of drivers during the race.  He battled fiercely despite a lack of overall pace, some 3.5 seconds off the leaders pace.  He'll want to cause less damage to himself and others if he wants to achieve better results.</p>
<p><strong>8th - roxas3sora3<br /></strong>Sora3 showed good pace in the rare times he had opportunity.  That he set fourth fastest race lap is testament to his improving pace.  He just needs to work on one lap speed to enable him to start higher up the grid and avoid some of the chaos that costs race time.</p>
<p><strong>9th - st8smn350</strong><br />Drove a good race to come up from the back of the grid to finish in the points.  Had a barnstorming drive in the wet qualifying to lap into 6th place, showing he has good car control. No doubt needs more track time and consistency to convert that into points.</p>
<p><strong>10th - CruiserComet<br /></strong>Cruiser appear to struggle for pace, some four seconds off the race pace and seven seconds off the qualifying pace.  That his race fastest lap was faster than his qualifying lap hints to a lack of preparation and track familiarity.</p>
<p><strong>11th - BreakerMorant<br /></strong>Again collecting a point for Ferrari, BreakerMorant was another driver to go faster in race than in practice. </p>
<p><strong>12th - Fredzfrog</strong><br />The little car that could. Fredzfrog again brought up the rear with consisent race and qualifying pace. </p>
<p><strong>DSQ - HolyGhost79<br /></strong>Have we seen the last of the Ghost?  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Drive of the Race</strong><br />As always, it's hard to not give drive of the race to the winner, but this week TurrbalTerror came from 9th place and a horror first three laps, after starting from pole, to secure third place. He did it by managing his fuel and tyres and running only two stops, with only the one prime tyre run.  This enabled him a number of good fast laps on the option tyre and low fuel, which made the difference.  <strong><br /></strong></p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Tumbleweeds could be seen blowing across the grid at Hungary prior to the race, as four of the top 5 drivers were absent from the event.  Qualifying on pole should have been a sure thing for Flouncy, but it was a hot lapping Modz85 that put his car on pole position. </p>
<p>The heavens opened for the race and that was all Flouncy needed to take the lead by the first corner, and was never headed, bringing the car home a full minute ahead of second place Eradicator84, with Modz85 slipping back to a respectable 3rd.</p>
<p>ET Rom had trouble on turn 1 of the race after Modz's poor getaway made him take evasion action from 3rd on the grid and he ran wide before hitting a spinning roxas3sora3, receiving a penalty and then being tapped by BreakerMorant on his way through.  From there, he limped home in 7th place ,his only saving grace being a thinned field.</p>]]></bodyText>

          <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Qualifying was an intense battle that ultimately fizzled, with large margins between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, all of whom occupied the 1:43's.  Flouncy reigned in qualifying, where the rain did not.</p>
<p>The forecast for the race was 80% chance of rain but the drivers were greeted with at least no falling rain, although the track was still damp and spray was kicked up as the cars left the start line. The race started cleanly with a few players jockying for position and as it sorted itself out, Flouncy and Atomic Lambo opened up a gap on the rest of the field, as TurrbalTerror was bullied out of his 3rd place down to 5th, as first Eradicator84 and then ET Rom asserted their positions through the first sector corners.</p>
<p>Roxas3sora3 was disqualified on the first lap, after his computer locked up and NightKid2 drove a cautious opening lap only to be black flagged after outbraking himself into the final turn and cutting too much of the corner.</p>
<p>Once the race started to settle down, the rains came and all the players made a dive for the pits, with some choosing Full Wets and other less fortunate drivers taking the Intermediate option, only to be called back in on the next lap, when the rain fell increasingly heavy.</p>
<p>Early leader Flouncy was caught out on the first pitstop, dropping back deep into the pack and a few laps later the redoubtable-in-the-rain HolyGhost79 was into lead, chased hard by TurrbalTerror and Atomic Lambo, himself closely tailed by Eradicator84. </p>
<p>Unfortunately a handful of laps later HolyGhost79 was in the pits, where he got the tyre selection wrong and exited on the gripless intermediate tyres.  The next 10 or so laps saw TurrbalTerror lead Atomic Lambo by a small margin, as the gap yo-yo'd between 1.8 and 3.5 seconds. Meanwhile the erstwhile Flouncy made his way up through the field and had claimed fourth position.</p>
<p>After ignoring his race engineers requests for new tyres for two laps, TurrbalTerror pitted on lap 18 and selected Intermediates, hoping the easing rain would provide a drying track and he could take a massive per lap speed advantage to get back in the lead.  Unfortunately the track was too wet and he spun his car on nearly every corner of the 19th lap before putting it into the wall at the last corner and retiring from the race.</p>
<p>Ultimately Atomic Lambo again prevailed over Flouncy.  After playing the long and cautious game, he didn't need to make a final stop near the end of the race and easily able to bring the car home in first.</p>
<p>Ferrari take home the constructors win with ET ROM placing a solid 4th.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Albert Park is set in the city area Melbourne, in the Albert Park centered by a large and picturesque lake.  The circuit is smooth and fast and flat and a favourite amongst pretty much all the F1 drivers.</p>
<p>This race is always closely fought, as everyone vies for home ground honours. The later race start time provides an unwelcomed deviation from the typical start time, with the sun well and truely in drivers eyes as they look for their braking points into turn 3.</p>
<p>Melbourne suits a medium to high downforce setting with hard springs.  Tyre wear is fairly high here too. </p>

<h2>Turn by turn</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1</strong>: Brake at the 100m marker and shift down to 4th, running over the inside kerb as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2: </strong>Lift for a moment as you ride the green fake grass on the inside of thturn then get back on the accellerator and straight line it as much as possible to the track out on the right side. Open DRS once you clear the apex</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3:</strong> Brake heavily at 80m and downshift to 2nd as you hit the apex.  Ride out to the left side then pull back to the right for turn 4.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4: </strong>Balance the throttle in 3rd gear, riding high and hard up over the inside of the turn.  As you clear the apex, smash it into 4th and point the car back to the left of the track.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5:</strong> You're almost brushing your left front against the green wall as you turn in.  Lift off the throttle for a moment before applying full throttle and upshifting to 6th mid corner.  Open DRS once you clear the apex.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8: </strong>Brake at 80m and downshift to 4th gear running over the grass to right as much as possible.  Open DRS and aim for the left hand side for turn 7.  You should be able to apply 100% with DRS open and not hear any wheelspin when cornering and shifting to 7th gear.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9 &amp; 10:</strong> Brake at 80m down to 3rd gear, bouncing the car over the grass on the inside of the corner, before heading over to the left for turn 10.  Open DRS and stick left.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 11 &amp; 12:  </strong>Brake gently at 120m and shift into 5th, aiming for the bollard on the inside, but just to the right.  Run up over the kerb and cut turn 12 short by a fair margin.  Open DRS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 13</strong>: Brake at 60m and shift down to 3rd, cutting the inside apex across the grass.  Grab 4th once past the apex and shift up to 5th before turn 14.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14: </strong>Shift down to 4th and floor it and grab 5th. Head over to the right for turn 15.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15</strong>: Brake at 60m and shift down to 2nd gear.  Apply half throttle through 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gear. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 16: </strong>Accelerate hard and engage DRS once past the apex.</p>]]></bodyText>

<h2>Turn by turn</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1:</strong> Brake at 60m and start turning at about 20m, still applying the brake.  Left foot brake here, so you can apply a small amount of throttle.  Hug the inside apex and move right ready for turn 2.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2 &amp; 3:</strong> Brake for the sharp turn as soon as you move right from turn 1 and hit 2nd gear while going slow, for maximum traction.  Apply a squirt of KERS and enable DRS as you drive through turn 3.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4:</strong> Brake at the 75m marker, dropping down to 3rd gear.  Ride over the inside kerb. Apply a small 20% of your KERS and activate DRS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5: </strong>Make sure you disable DRS before turning, so as to avoid a spin, and keep the car in 5th gear, even if it means bouncing off the limiter.  You need to balance the throttle here to avoid oversteer.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6:</strong> Ride up over the inside kerb. If you get the line right you'll keep it in 5th with the revs up high (I didn't get it right in the above video, but I have on other occassions, for a better lap time). Engage DRS and 10% of KERS just before you reach track out.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 7 &amp; 8: </strong>Ensure DRS is off when you kick it back to 5th at about 50m and as you turn, apply the brakes and shift down to 4th, riding up over the inside kerb.  Keep the steering input constant for turn 8 and as soon as you clear the apex apply 100% throttle, DRS and 20% KERS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9: </strong>Brake at 75m and shift down to 2nd gear aiming for the inside kerb (I missed my apex in the above video, then got horribly out of shape on the exit).  Balance the throttle as you rise up the hill and select 4th and turn for turn 10.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 10:</strong> Turn and grab 5th on exit, staying out wide. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 11: </strong>Trail brake through the turn into a late apex, shifting down to 3rd, before back up to 5th.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 12: </strong>Grab 6th gear and run up and over the kerb on the inside, going to wide and right for turn 13.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 13: </strong>Run up over the fake grass on the inside and run wide for 14.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14: </strong>This turn is a lot like turn 11.  Trail brake down to third, applying both accelerator and brake and almost hitting the bollard. Engage DRS and all but 10% of your remaining KERS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15: </strong>Brake at 60m and drop down to 3rd gear, balancing the throttle through the turn.  At track out engage DRS and use the remaining KERS.</p>
<h2>Overtaking zones</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1 &amp; 2 </strong>is a good place to overtake.  You can either outbrake up the inside or outbrake around the outside, if you've got a bucket load of traction.  Going the outside will put you in good track position for turn 2.  Going the inside, the driver your passing could hang you out to dry on turn 2, so you'll be running the risk of going off track. </p>
<p>I'd consider <strong>turn 4</strong> briefly but I advise against it, it's more  gradual corner than an outbrake and shove it up the inside, although if you do get a good run passing here will prevent the other car from cutting back under you. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 9 </strong>looks like it will over some overtaking opportunities but be careful of cars taking a late apex.  They'll brake later and then cut in sharply, so to overtake you'll need to really get in and get visible before the apex.   Not a safe bet to overtake here.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14</strong> is a good place to attempt a pass.  The tightening radius means you can get up the inside of someone and cut them off/push them wide, ruining their run for the straight and the chance they'll have a go at you for turn 15.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15 </strong>is a great place to overtake because you can get around here fast with a few different apexes, and the track is nice and wide.  Not getting an overtake perfect here though will mean the other car will get a good tow and a have a run at you coming into to turn 1.</p>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>Turn by turn</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1 &amp; 2:</strong> This turn can be pretty tricky and I found a safe way to get quickly around it is to simply lift off the accelerator at 80m and slow down using the gears only.  Braking mid corner unsettles the car and causes understeer, mnaking it hard to get around the decreasing radius of 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3 &amp; 4: </strong>Brake gently for the apex and drift out for a late track out on the right, accelerating hard.  Turns 3 and 4 are essentially one corner.  Apply KERS once almost at the track out.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5</strong>: Flat out with DRS open.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6:</strong> Brake at about 90m and run hard up over the inside kerb before pushing left and coming back right.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 7 &amp; 8:</strong> Balance the throttle through the long left hander, changing down to 4th and for the right hand turn 8. This is similar to turns 5 and 6 at Sepang, high speed change of direction.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9 &amp; 10:</strong> Slown down to 2nd clipping the apex of 9 and pushing wide right out to track out.  Be mindful of the curb as you turn in for 10.  Once you've got the car pointed at the apex for 10, open the throttle, the DRS  and use some KERS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 11 &amp; 12 &amp; 13</strong>: Brake for 11 at about 100m.  You can really attack the inside curb here and gain a good chunk of time by basically cutting the corner.  This helps improve the angle of attack for turn 12.   Balance the throttle while you get the car pointed for the banked 13.  Once the back end is stable, apply full throttle and smoothly move out wide to the left. Active DRS once you're straight.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14 &amp; 15:</strong>  You'll be carrying a lot of speed into the braking zone for turn 15, probably at least 340kph, so you'll need to brake early, at about 130m and ride hard up over the curb at the apex. Gently apply throttle until you're nearly straight then floor it through turn 15.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 16</strong>: Brake at 50m and shift down to 4th, running over the side curb to the outside edge, using all the available road. Accelerate hard.  You will have used al your KERS before this corner.</p>
<h2>Overtaking Zones</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 6 </strong>is the first real overtaking opportunity, as if you get a good run out of turn 3 you'll be carrying a lot of speed into the corner.  As the corner tightens, be careful of the person your overtaking cutting back underneath you.  If you place your car strategically you can prevent this. </p>
<p>Overtaking cane be done at <strong>turn 11</strong> but be mindfull people will be cutting the corner and bouncing over the curb and then straight lining it as much as possible.  I'd avoid an attempt here unless the car in front is significantly slower. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 14</strong> is another good opportunity, and probably the safest thanks to the use of DRS down the straight and then a huge braking zone.  This was the prime passing spot in the real grand prix.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul Park is one extremely technical challenge, or at least that's what I'm finding.  The main problem is the different types of corners, requiring a different direction in car setup for each.  There are some constant radius cornes like turns 1 and 4, some blind apex corners, with no accurate braking markers, like turn 3, changing radius off camber turns like turn 2, and don't forget the monster turn in Formula 1, Turn 8.</p>
<p>Turn 8 is a multiple apex behemoth that will make or break your lap.  The car spends around 7 to 8 seconds in this turn and getting any one of the apex's wrong will push you wide and off track.  Not only is it a difficult corner, it precdes a long down hill run into a tight left hander, a good overtaking opportunity, meaning if you mess up turn 8 and manage to stay on track, you'll get pinched in turn 9 or 10.  My attack of Turn 8 involves medium throttle 5th gear, trail braking to keep online, before punching into 6th before the final apex, where I tightly hug the inside.  I've found soft spring settings on the car help give maximum cornering grip for this turn.</p>
<p>Turn 8 isn't the only drama, I've long struggled with turn 1.  Brake too late and for sure you'll understeer off the track and blow your chances at a the run up the hill through turn 2.  I'm braking well before the 100m and getting the car settled with a slower entry speed.</p>
<p>Turn 2 is ok, it's just nail the throttle and try and straightline as much possible before turn 3.  Turn 3 apex is blind, so practice is the key here.  Miss you're braking point slightly and the off camber corner will push you wide and completely ruin Turn 4.  Turn 4, 5, and 6 are pretty standard low speed, 2nd or 3rd gear turns.</p>
<p>Turn 7 is a little trickier than the few before it, with the radius opening up as you charge up the hill toward turn 8.  I prefer to hug the inside , but I've seen plenty of drivers take a late entry and move the apex further round.  I might give it a try at my next practice session.</p>
<p>I find turns 12, 13, and 14 pretty important for a lap time too.  The car is at its fastet as it approaches turn 12, moving at just over 340 kph.  12 sets the car up for 13, where the early application of power can easily result in a spin and usually ruins your turn in and track out of turn 14.  If I'm not careful, I often approach 12 too fast and don't clip the inside of the turn, also understeering to the outside and the inside of turn 13 on completely the wrong angle.  That ends up effecting my turn in for 14.  Pretty much it's a series of undesteering corners if turn 12 gets messy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overtaking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turn 12</strong> is the best overtaking corner as ithe straight from 11 to 12 is the DRS zone, so cars will be carrying maximum speed down here. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 7</strong> is also a good spot for sticking it up the inside, as many cars could understeer here.  Just be careful that overtaking on the inside doesn't leave you hung out to dry through turn 8, as if you're on the outside there and have another car on your left, alongside they can just push you wide and off the track into a high speed incident.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9 </strong>is also a decent overtaking opportunity, as is <strong>Turn 1</strong>, but just beware you track position on turn 1 as it's easy to get pushed off track on the exit of of 1, if you're on the outside, or going through turn 2 if you take on the inside.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Monaco is the crown jewel of the F1 calendar. The last remaining true street circuit, it represents the ultimate challenge to a drivers concentration, talent, and bravado.  Getting a pole lap at Monaco is all about commitment and millimeter precision driving, combined with extreme fine motor skill in the right foot.</p>
<p>Previous Monaco Atomic F1 grand prix's have all be crashfests and demolision derbies, with one definite King of Monaco, Atomic Lambo. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 1 (Sainte Devote)</strong>: Slightly reprofiled from previous years, after the pit entrance moved from before to after this corner.  Brake at 65m and shift down to 3rd gear, before getting on the power, with DRS and KERS immediately clear of the apex.  Good drive out of this corner is important for the blast up the hill.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2 (Beau Rivage)</strong>: More of a flat out blast in 7th gear than a corner.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3 (Massenet):</strong> Left foot brake and shift down through 5th and 4th mid corner.  Hug the inside for the turn into turn 4.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4 (Casino)</strong>: 3rd gear through the apex and get on the KERS and DRS early for maximum speed.  Use KERS in the race and you may be able to outbrake your opponent into Mirabeau.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5 (Mirabeau)</strong>: 1st gear.  You should notice the sector 1 time here.  A good lap is a low 18s split.  Quickly change up to 2nd as you head toward the hairpin.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6:</strong> The sharpest and slowest turn in formula 1. The cars dial in extra steering lock just for this 80km/hr corner.  Be careful not to carry too much speed or you will understeer into the outside wall. Definitely 1st gear.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 7:</strong> Change into 2nd, trying your best to minimise wheel spin and control your car, avoiding the inside curb which if struck hard may pitch you into the outside wall.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 8 (Porter)</strong>: Try and avoid staring out over the harbour vista and smoothly transition from 2nd to 3rd gear, minimising wheel spin.  You want maximum speed for the "straight" up ahead and possibly one of the only overtaking opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9 (Tunnel)</strong>: A bumpy right hander in the dark. The tunnel can be taken flat out, with 100% throttle, KERS, and DRS, if you get it right.  Get it wrong and you're definitely facing the wrong way with a panelbeaters bill.  Don't be like Massa and Hamilton in 2011 and try and overtake through this turn.  The result will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 10 &amp; 11 (Chicane)</strong>: Get your braking right, starting at about 65m.  Lock a wheel and you'll either get a penalty for overshooting the corner, or you'll be massively offline and run the risk of hitting the wall through 11.  You can easily lose a second if you get it wrong here.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 12 (Tabac)</strong>: Taken in 4th, but be careful with the throttle.  A tail-happy car is a backward facing car with a broken nose, parked on a blind highspeed corner. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 13 &amp; 14 (Swiming Pool)</strong>: Taken in 5th &amp; 6th (shift mid corner).  100% throttle.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15 &amp; 16</strong>: Taken in 2nd.  Run over the kerbs to keep your time low.  Check your sector 2 split.  A good split is low 53's. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 17 &amp; 18 (La Rascasse)</strong>: Brake for 18 just after the apex/kink of 17 and drop it down to 2nd. Gentle on the throttle as you minimise wheel spin for a good line through the final turn.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 19</strong>: Taken in 2nd, straightlining and getting on the DRS and any remaining KERS.  Front left wheel may ride against the left ripple strip but be careful not to hit the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Expected Pole Time:  </strong>Low 1:09's and lower.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overtaking</strong>: Turn 1, if the driver in front is offline.  Try not to hit the car as you up the inside, or you'll push them into the wall and ruin their race.  Turn 10 maybe.  If you're brave on the brakes.  Turn 15: see previous comment.  Monaco is extremely difficult to pass on, but with an expected high number of unforced errors, and 38 laps, passing should be a waiting game. People will come unstuck, and if they don't, they're probably faster than you anyway.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The F1 2011 specification Circuit de Gilles Villenueve is a track that can and must be attacked hard.  Gently massaging the car through the corners is not the way to a fast lap time.  The secret is to get your rage on and smash the car through the corners and you'll be rewarded with a fast time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Turn 1:</strong> Enter the corner in 3rd gear and shift down to 2nd midway between this and turn 2.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2: </strong>Hug the inside and shift into early 3rd getting on the DRS and KERS early.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3:</strong> Brake at the 80m mark and shift down to 3rd.  Cut the corner early, getting heaps of curb, straight lining as much as possible for turn 4.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4:</strong> This corner can be cut by a large amount without recieving a penalty, so make use of that grass but don't power on too much whilst on the grass.  Get on the DRS as soon as you're off the grass.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5:</strong> Almost hit the wall on the inside (right) and stay right, to brake early for 6.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6 &amp; 7:</strong> Cut the corner across the red curbing in second and tap the brake for turn 7 before getting on the gas at 90% throttle.  Once your half way past the apex to the track out, apply DRS and KERS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 8 &amp; 9:</strong> Brake at about 90m and shift down to third.  Turn early and run over the inside curb, taking your car to the apex of turn 9 where you apply DRS and a burst of KERS.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 10 &amp; 11:</strong> Brake at 80m and shift down to 2nd.   Run the car out against the wall before getting on the throttle and short shifting through to 4th. KERS and DRS over the bend that is turn 11 and down the straight.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 12 &amp; 13:</strong> Brake down to 3rd and smash it over the curb through turn 12 and 13 and get back on the DRS when you land :).  </p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>When I first started playing Formula 1 games and simulations (Geoff Crammands original Grand Prix), Silverstone was a pretty basic series of straights punctuated by fast turns.  The new Silverstone, with recently remodeled section from Abbey through to Brooklands changes the dynamic of the track, making it much more of a challenge.</p>
<p>For my first few laps out I used the fastest setup available in the quick setups and I stuggled to stop the back end from stepping out.  Every corner was a massive challenge and it was some time before I could put together a lap that was basically error free.</p>
<p>The key to Silverstone is, more than most circuits, balancing throttle, steering and brakes.  Most corners are not just brake hard on entry then when slow enough turn in, wait for the apex and then mash the throttle to the floor. This applies even at from the first corner, Copse, where breaking too late will put cause massive understeer and push you out into the large run off areas.</p>
<p>The fast esses through Maggots, Beckets, and Chapel are also not as easy as they first appear.  Maggots can be taken flat in seventh but you need to down shift as soon as you clear the appex so you can hug the inside of turn 3, for a good line into Becketts.  Becketts will be taken in fifth, hugging the left of the track as you clip the apex before quickly downshifting into third and dancing on the throttle to minimise both wheel spin and understeer which will ruin Chapel and the important run down the straight.</p>
<p>Stowe is a tricky uphill blind right hander and another corner that requires progressive throttle control to minimise understeer.  Stabbing the brakes at the 100m sign and downshifting to 4th as you turn in is the way to attack this corner.  Constant revs and 4th needs to be held to the apex, where you can get on the gas and ride the rumble strip on exit and down to Vale.</p>
<p>Vale is a tight first gear left hander, hidden behind a small hill as you come down from Stowe.  My braking point is just after I crest the hill and I shift down into first and point the car at the inside rumble strip and prepare for Club by pushing right on exit and just missing the right rumble strip on it's entry.</p>
<p>Club is effectively two left handers but the exiting from Vale and pushing as wide as possible through club you can should be turning it into one corner and bouncing over the inside of the 2nd turn before blasting up the hill to Abbey.</p>
<p>Downshift into 5th for Abbey, allowing the car to slow enough to not understeer on entry, before mashing the throttle after the apex and pointing the car a little wide on the right handside of Farm Curve.  Aim to hit the brakes at about 120m and slow down to first gear for Village, clipping the inside of the corner before swinging left and through The Loop in constant revs second gear. Once through the corner, nail the throttle flat through Aintree down Wellington Straight and heading into Brooklands.</p>
<p>I found Brooklands a touch tricky on the first few attempts, breaking too heavily and not turning left while doing so.  The end result was I ran well off track.  You need to start slowing for Brooklands just before the 100m mark.  Jab the brakes as you turn left.  The dabbing will better help you turn as you slow and you need to downshift to 2nd and keep turning left as the radius tightens.  Once it stops tightening, head straight for the entry of Luffied and hug the inside.  Resist the urge to use full throttle or you'll find yourself off line for Woodcote and the final straight, leaving yourself open for being passed at Copse.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>I read that Formula 1 drivers vote Suzuka as pretty much their favourite circuit due to it's punishing nature.  The Honda owned circuit requires precision at every corner or you lose great chunks of time.  And they're right.  Suzuka is every bit as impressive to drive in F1 2010 as it is to watch the real guys on it.</p>
<p>I develop all my setups in Practice of individual Grand Prix's and Suzuka is the most difficult track to meet the AI times.  I started by using the default car setup and was seconds off the pace of the 23rd place runner.  That's a huge margin considering he's seconds off the fastest driver and I'm usually on the pace of, or faster than, the fastest AI time in my Mclaren.</p>
<p>There isn't a corner at Suzuka that isn't a challenge.  Not a corner where it didn't take a few hours of practicing the track before I started to make noticeable improvements.</p>
<p>First up is 'First Curve' which is entered in 5th and braking is continued all the way through to T2 which is best taken by hugging the inside in 2nd gear.  I then accelerate up to 5th gear into T3 and the 'S' curves, taking T3 in 5th before downshifting into 4th for the remaining 'S' Curve turns.  Dunlop curve is tough, requiring a balancing throttle and mid RPM until you sight the exist of the corner at the top of the hill and can nail it, confident you want run wide.</p>
<p>Initially I thoight Degner 1 would be second gear, and without curb hopping it would be, but I found it's 4th/5th gear if you cut the inside tight and brake as you turn, keeping the car wide so you can do the same again for the 2nd gear Degner 2 and the run into Hairpin.  Hairpin is a corner a struggle with, as with all the corners in sector 2, where I'm losing up to 2 seconds on the top AI guys. I brake for Hairpin at the ripple strip on the inside of T10 and then try and hug the corner through T11 before getting on the power.  I've noticed that pretty much all the AI cars catch me through this turn and I've frankly got no answer.  Although I feel moving to right foot braking might help.</p>
<p>Once out of the Hairpin it's flat out through until T13 and the mighty Spoon turn, a corner which continually kicks my arse.  Shifting down into 3rd gear gets me round T13 and then slowing and hugging the inside of T14.   I feel I lose a lot of time through Spoon and it always feels awkward.  This leaves only the last two turns which I can take better than any AI, the final fast left 130R @ about 315kph and the tight Casino Triangle, where like most tight chicanes, a heap of time can be lost if you get your breaking slightly wrong.</p>]]></bodyText>

<h2>Turn by turn</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1:</strong> This corner seems to catch out a number of drivers on multiple occasions each during a race.  The best approach is start breaking at about 125m and keep wide, slowing down to low 2nd gear and clearing the apex before applying full throttle.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2:</strong> A 100% thottle turn.  Use your minimap to watch for cars exiting the pit lane.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3</strong>: A tough corner to get right due to the high approach speed.  Start braking at or just after the first brake marker at 150m.  My preferred approach is to downshift all the way to first then as soon as I hit first, shift back up into second and and aim for the late apex.  The car should move toward the trackout at the left side and apply full throttle, short-shifting to get traction.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4: </strong>Apply the brakes at about the 125m marker and aim for a late apex to try and straightline as early as possible.  I like to use the technique of downshifting quickly to first before going back into second for the drive through the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5</strong>: A quick shift up to third and back into second will see you out wide on the left to swing back to the right for turn 6.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6</strong>: No sooner than you apply light throttle from turn 5, it's time to hit the brakes for turn 6 and a tight line throug the corner.  Keep off the outside ripple strip so you can get maximumn traction up the hill.  The stopwatch should read about 48.5s when you hit trackout.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 7</strong>: This corner comes with a slight lift, to make sure you don't go wide and then to tight into 8.  You should be in 6th gear.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 8:</strong> Hug the inside and bang it into 7th briefly before braking for turn 9.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9:</strong> Shift back to 4th geat and touch the apex before giving enough throttle to naturally push to the right and the edge of the track. Into 5th gear before turn 10.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 10:</strong> Quickly shift down to 2nd gear and low revs.  Touch the left ripple strip on track out and gently apply throttle, until off the ripple strip.  Accelarate hard to 5th gear.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 11: </strong>This is a tricky multi-apex corner for novices and requires a gently balanced car and throttle.  When you hit apex one down shift to 3rd and drift wide, about three quarters the way to the right side of the track before brushing the brakes for the 2nd apex.  Fourth gear can be used on exit if you're feeling brave and get the corner right.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 12:</strong> If you've made 4th gear, shift down to 3rd as you enter the corner and apply 50% throttle.  When the steering wheel is nearly straight, shift into 4th and give smooth progression to full throttle. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 13: </strong>Lift in fourth and once you clear the apex apply 50% gradually increasing to 100% throttle until the breaking for turn 14.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14: </strong>Shift down to 3rd gear as you start turning, and are already breaking.  50% throttle 3rd gear and select 4th as you clear the apex but do not yet have a straight wheel. Aim for the right hand side of the track, trying to kiss the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15: </strong>Drop down from 3rd into 2nd and take a late apex trying to keep the settled for entry into turn 16.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 16:</strong> Just miss the ripple strip on the left and change into 3rd and then 4th. </p>
<p><strong>Turn 17/18:</strong> 50%-75% throttle and you massage steering input to control understeer. It's important to keep the car to the right. I like to hug the wall.  Once you can see the turn 18 apex, make a straightline through it and down the pit straight at full throttle.</p></p>]]></bodyText>

<h2>Turn by turn</h2>
<p><strong>Turn 1</strong>: Start braking at about 120m and slow down to third gear before the apex.  Ride the kerb and hit the apex and as soon as you clear the apex and the kerb you should be almost sliding over to the track-out at the edge of the track.  Change into forth and apply full throttle with an early shift to 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2</strong>: Ride up on the ripple strip and hold the throttle flat.  Get ready for the change of direction through T3.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3</strong>: Full throttle, hugging the inside of the corner, using the ripple strip but be careful not to hit the bollard.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4</strong>: You should have pushed wide as you accelerrated through turn 3 and be able to clip the inside ripple strip of the turn.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5</strong>: Brake at about the 110m point and aim the nose of the car so you just run over the ripple strip on entry, slowing down to first when you're in the middle of the road into T6</p>
<p><strong>Turn 6</strong>: Pause throttle input for a split second, change back up to second and apply 25% throttle and engage 3rd</p>
<p><strong>Turn 7</strong>: Run it wide and deep out to the right, over the ripple strip so you're almost hitting the wall, and dump it down to first then straight back to second, for a late apex, trying to straightline the corner as much as possible. Once you've cleared the apex mash the throttle to the floor and accelerate like mad</p>
<p><strong>Turn 8</strong>: Start your braking at about 125m and cadence brake while shifting down to 2nd.  You should be coasting up to the corner in second and could change down to 1st, but don't, it'll help keep the car steady. Run a late apex because you want to stick the left as much as you can for turn 9.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 9</strong>: Shift up to 3rd.  You don't need to but it allows you to minimize wheelspin and get a great exit.  I followed every driver during the race and everyone was substantially slower than me out of this turn (and turn 7). I'm going to assume it's because of this.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 10</strong>: Flat out accelarate.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 11</strong>: Brake at 125m and bounce over the ripple strip and wide off track proper.  Hit it down to 2nd gear and use the kerbs on the inside of the turn.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 12 &amp; 13</strong>: Bounce over the kerbs and get the car settled for 14.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 14</strong>: An instant after your car settles get on the anchors and down to 2nd and up to 3rd once you clear the apex, but only apply 25% throttle.  Once you hit track out, nail it.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 15</strong>: Hold it flat to the floor</p>
<p><strong>Turn 16</strong>: Hold it flat on turn in and start engine braking when you're half way from the apex to track out.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 17</strong>: Change down to 1st and pull 2nd as soon as you clear the apex.  Once you're nearly straight accelerate into 3rd and get ready to dump it down a gear for turn 18</p>
<p><strong>Turn 18</strong>: Change down to second and hop the inside kerb before changing up to 3rd</p>
<p><strong>Turn 19</strong>: Back to second and run over the kerbs.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 20</strong>: Start shift down to second at 65m and hit the apex shifting up to 4th.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 21</strong>: Down to 2nd and balance the throttle and steering until you hit trackout at the end of the track then floor it.</p>
<p>The key to a good lap at Yas Marina is to have a car that can ride the kerbs.</p></p>]]></bodyText>

TurrbalTerror has the ability to put his machine on pole, and set fastest laps during the race, but his qualifying performances are squandered by poor race starts, being caught in the midfield or being pushed aside by faster guys coming up the grid.  His tendancy to overdrive makes him his own worst enemy.  Not a race likely race winner but could finish on the podium if others have bad luck.]]></summary>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>TurrbalTerror has held his 20 year F1 fan badge for a few years now, following the sport since the days when Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, and Nelson Piquet battled it out for race wins. He's played most every PC based F1 "sim" game since the PC XY, from Accolades Grand Prix, through Geoff Crammonds Grand Prix series and Codemasters F1 franchise, with most his current track time going to iRacing.</p>
<p>Ironically Season 4 has been the season where he's shown the most pace and consistency during the races, with almost 0 driving errors.&nbsp; He has, unfortunately, far and away the worst luck with fuel management and other issues relating to strategy, robbing him of a few wins and many strong podium finishes.</p>
<p>Perhaps if he spent more time practicing F1 2011 and less time maintaining atomicf1.com, he'd be more successful.&nbsp; But as his pappy said "Stick with what you're good at son.".</p>

        <summary><![CDATA[Atomic Lambo is fast. Very fast.  He's also consistent and more than capable of running at the front. A few mistakes at critical times have seen his championship aspirations be thwarted of late but increased practice time means he's again a dominant force.]]></summary>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Lambo's foray into racing games was quite late having come from the FPS generation. It would be well into his early 20's before he would take up any sort of motorsport game, but once he had, he was hooked. Lambo's first taste of racing was at university when a group of keen enthusiast gamers decided to partake in a round of Geoff Crammond's 'Grand Prix IV'. Not owning a wheel at the time he borrowed one, and even tho he was easily beaten at that first race he was hooked. It was soon after that he purchased his first steering wheel, the Logitech Formula. Despite the fact it had no force feedback, used the game port connection and not USB, had a big spring to center the wheel and would occasionally twitch like crazy, it would be the catalyst for an ongoing love affair with gaming motorsport. <br /><br />Competitive on-line racing started with V8 Supercars with a group of loyal and dedicated racers from the Atomicmpc forums, moving to V8 Supercars 2 to the sequel, and finally now to F1 2010. Lambo can boast being the first championship winner and one of the key founders of the Atomic F1 Championship which is now proudly into its 3rd season. <br /><br />With 14 wins from 46 starts and a healthy 34 podiums, Lambo is a regular points finisher who despite tripping on a few hurdles this season is very much in the hunt to secure a 2nd championship.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>With a career in racing games dating back to Lotus challenge on the Amiga 500, HG has shown solid knowledge on how to keep a virtual car on a virtual track.<br /><br />With his first real computer, HG purchased a copy of Viper Racing. This game finally brought realism to the table for him with physics and car setups, unfortunately the only controller he had at the time was a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro Joystick. This presented only a slight problem and he managed to make do and play the game.<br /><br />The release of a console from MS, and a game called Rally Sport Challenge saw a more competitive HG emerge, with a very fierce rivalry between himself, his brother and father. The 3 of them would compete over and over on one track until we knew every inch and were racing for hundredths of a second. V8 supercars tragics, the family then moved onto V8 supercars 1, 2 and 3, and again we were competing for microseconds.<br /><br />After a stint away from racing, HG forgot how to use a controller to control a virtual car. His thumbs just would not work anymore on such a tiny thumbstick. He decided it was time to buy a wheel and bought a Logitech Momo Racing wheel to go with a new game he bought called GT Legends. This game was amazing and amazingly frustrating at the same time. Cars just would not stick to the road and required very precise throttle control to get anywhere in a race. This was the training for HG's wet weather racing prowess that he is known for. From this game on, his throttle and brake control would never be the same. Racing in GTR2 was next in his career, a very slippery game if you have the car setups wrong. Not much of an engineer he never really used setups anyway and just learnt to race on slippery surfaces.<br /><br />HG joined Atomic's F1 2010 championship at the beginning and has seen a steady improvement over the 3 seasons. At the start, he was able to keep pace with the 4th and 5th competitors, happy just to finish a race and hoping not to hit anyone and take them out. During this time he learnt the tracks and each drivers racing styles. Season 2 his ranking rose with a couple of wins and podium finishes. It was this season that HG showed his rain racing skill. Season 2 also showed off his lacking pit tire change skills, costing him positions on a couple of tracks. Season 3 has seen HG rise to the top of the ladder at the start of the season. He is hoping he can maintain the lead from Flouncy, Atomic Lambo and a reinspired TurrbalTerror who are all eager for the championship title.</p>]]></bodyText>

<p>Details of Mac Dude’s start in racing are lost in time, though evidence of his first race first corner miss still exist. While comfortable on kiddy racing games like Wild Wild Racing on the Playstation, stepping up to grown-up persuits always seemed a bridge too far.<br /><br />Improvement was seen during those whacky days of Gran Turismo 4 using a D pad, however experience with a yum cha brand wheel completely killed Mac Dude’s budding career. Such controllers are the work of the devil.<br /><br />Recently Mac Dude’s latent racing itch awoke through lurking in the atomic F1 thread and a spate of speeding tickets. The deal was sealed by Lambo’s donation of his training wheel and the rest is history. Mac Dude is using the winter 2011 season to get ready for 2011, if you know what I mean. Getting the right racing position, car setup, learning how to choose tyres and the purpose of visiting the pits aside from the mandatory mid-race twinkle (the g-forces play havoc with his bladder).<br /><br />Current goals are modest – start a race from any other position on the grid other than last and to actually finish a fuckin race.<br /><br />A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.<br /><br />Vroom Vroom…</p>]]></bodyText>

After appearing irregularly in previous seasons, Williams have got themselves a strong driver pairing with inclusion of sora in their team.  Widely regarded as Fredzfrogs nemisis he is sure to ignite races and thrill crowds as he battles for mid-field supremacy and the right to be #1 driver in his team.]]></summary>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The passion for roxas3sora3 started at a young age at 5 when he laid eyes on the Mazda 737B winning Le Mans on a small CRT TV in the lounge room. Swearing he'll get into motorsport some day, that dream was crushed at the lack of enthusiasm by his parents. Although there were many distractions between that elusive dream and as well as other factors such as new FPS games, it took until Gran Turismo 4 and as well as the purchase of the Logitech Driving Force EX wheel to reignite that passion.</p>
<p>After several seasons competing singularly on the GT circuits and as well as other racing games, it took 2010 before roxas3sora3 got into F1 after earning his stripes on the F1 simulation at Atomic Live. Though he was 7 seconds off the lead, he finally broke through on F1 2010 being a lead driver for Virgin Racing. It wasn't long before he made his presence felt at the second season with a third place podium. However, inconsistent family moments and as well as thoughts over his future stemmed his pace for season three. In the rare participation occasions, he has shown much improvement in qualifying but albeit slower race pace.</p>
<p>He'll be looking forward to the new season given it is a new slate for all competitors.</p>]]></bodyText>

<p>Following the departure of Flouncy to Renault at the end of Season 1, Force India took on upcoming driver TurralTerror to give some weight to their constructors championship bid for season 2.</p>
<p><strong>Season 4</strong><br />Sees the first year where Force India has not enlisted the services of it's stalwart Atomic Lambo.  Things may be not be the same for this team now in apparent decline.  Krispy89 has signed with the team but is yet to make an appearance, halfway through the season.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the history of the Atomic F1 champsionship McLaren have unexpectedly enjoyed only moderate success.  Their season 1 pairing of TurrbalTerror and bobaj0r failed to net either title.  It wasn't until Flouncy arrived on the scene with a fast teammate in Eradicator84 that they managed championship success, taking out the Drivers title.  Season 3 saw a return to the familiar lineup of TurrbalTerror and bobaj0r, which while they managed to secure a victory and a few pole positions, they placed below their own expectations in both title chases.</p>
<p>The woking based team have again signed TurrbalTerror and bobaj0r for Season 4.  Thanks to the teamming rules introduced in this season, McLaren are expected to dominate the constructors title this year, with two very fast, yet inconsistent drivers.  If both drivers can make every event and keep it on track, it will take an act of God to stop McLaren.</p>]]></bodyText>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Despite his move to Red Bull Racing there seems to be no list of companies willing to line up behind F1 driver Krispy.  Atomic F1 today confirmed that Krispy will now feature the famous brand on the livery of the RB6 for the rest of the season.  <br /> <br /> A spokes model for Libra had this to say, "we are thrilled to be onboard with Krispy for the rest of the season and hope to be able to provide with him all the comfort and protection he needs, and with as many wings as necessary to stay dry and fresh."</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>In a not so surprising development, it's been revealed that former Lotus driver Ghost was kicked out for indiscretions at their annual team meeting. "The truth of the matter was that I was kicked out of Lotus after being caught naked and drunk on the roof of the hotel with hookers and cocaine.  But as that was all an internal matter, no other team knew about it and I was snatched up by Williams."  Mike Gascoyne says that it is unfortunate that Ghost had to leave. "I wish him good luck in Williams and hope he'll have a fun time with them." It is unknown why Williams wanted Ghost after this incident, however reports have confirmed the departing of Krispy to Red Bull.  Frank Williams has confirmed that the lack of pace shown by Krispy was the reason for his departure to Red Bull.  "In the interest of the team, Krispy departed because of a lack of results.  I do believe he wanted a team mate to support and so I support his decision to move."</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Virgin racing team principal John Booth shrugged aside rumours that Virgin Racing may bow out of the competition. "At the moment, we're doing the best we can given the circumstances of joining this late and not having tested the car as much we'd like . Roxas3sora3 has given us some solid results given that we've been expecting to be at the back of the field. Roxas3sora3 managed to put us into 8th and 6th respective. Hopefully for the next few rounds, we can pick up the pace and translate it into decent lap times." roxas3sora3 shares the same sentiment. "The problem is that I'm just new to the scene and to be honest, my lap times are reflecting that issue. I'm not a wonder machine that the other drivers are. Hopefully for next round, it can be translated better than 8th or 6th."</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Mclarens early season form was marred by inconsistency and reliability issues, however team boss Martin Whitmarsh believes that his team has now solved those issues and is looking forward to challenging the front runners Force India again.  "We discovered a flaw in our car design that was impacting performance and reliability and I apologise to Kikz especially that this wasn't discovered earlier."  When asked what the issue was Whitmarsh revealed that a faulty automatic garage door was to blame. "We discovered a fault in Kikz's garage door mechanism and we believe this is the source of our troubles in the MP4-25."  When asked if using such a device as opposed to other teams like Force India who opted for slower but more reliable manual roller doors was a mistake Whitmarsh assured fans  "Certainly not, the performance benefit far out ways the negatives of using such a system." <br /> <br /> While automatic doors won't be banned next season, the Formula One Teams Association has unanimously voted to not use the technology in 2011.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Current Willams driver Mark84 has been rumoured to be considering making the switching from Formula One to Super Mario Kart at the end of the 2010 Atomic F1 season. Inside sources within the paddock report that Mark84 has been un-happy at Williams and is considering leaving the sport to pursue the possibility of driving in the lucrative Japanese series. Mark84’s manager Koopa Troopa could neither confirm nor deny the rumours. “Mark84 has a contract with Williams till the end of the current season and he intends to honour that contract fully.” Requests for comment from Mark84 directly have been met with silence, however one insider believes if he does make the switch it “will throw the F1 driver market wide open.”  It is not the first time an F1 driver has made the switch, in 1992 Princess Peach after a successful stint at Benetton left to take up a seat in the famous '1Up' Kart Team.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>The surprise DNF result from roxas3sora3 was main word across pit lane after the young driver bowed out of contention just one lap into the race. Escaping a chaotic first corner in 4th (up from 8th), roxas3sora3 retired without even finishing the first lap. It was unknown why he had thrown in the towel but reports seems to circulate that the driver was forced to retire due to personal reasons. In a statement today, roxas3sora3 asked everyone to keep racing and keep him in their thoughts. <br /> <br /> When asked, John Booth shrugged his shoulders. "This is a personal moment for roxas3sora3. As a team, we're just as shocked as he is for that decision. If it came down to me, I would have done the same. No man would make such a decision lightly without bearing the cost of that. He's a strong and passionate driver. Hopefully, the next few races will get the man back."<br /> <br /> The race was marked with drama throughout qualifying with bushipoo hitting the barrier hard in the last few minutes of qualifying. During the first lap, the track caught out several drivers, with the first 3 and roxas3sora3 escaping the carnage. After the retirement of roxas3sora3, the race remained incident free apart from several wings being lost and punctures which costed several drivers. With the weekend over, it remains to see whether or not roxas3sora3 can bounce back from the painful finish he had to endure.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh is refusing to give up on his teams chances of winning the constructors championship despite now being more than 60 points behind with only two races left.  "We can still do it.  We have some updates coming up that will give us an edge in the next two races which we think will close the gap to Force India."  When asked how that can be considering the points gap with only two races left, Whitmarsh explained "we won't give up till it's mathematically impossible."  Driver bobaj0r felt that the team were close but not close enough.  "For sure the performance is there, and if we had say seven or eight more races without Force India, I think we could certainly win."  Force India's Vijay Mallya dismissed Whitmarsh's comments as 'retarded'.</p>
<p>With only two races remaining the battle for second is very much between Williams and Mclaren with only 18 points separating them.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>With the chequered flag now falling on the final race and the seasong coming to a close, we recap the last 19 rounds and announce the winners of the first annual Atomic F1 awards voted by the drivers themselves.  Our resident Atomic F1 expert Jonathan Legard reports.<br /> <br /> Going into the season opener in Bahrain there was high expectations from within the Atomic F1 paddock.  There was pressure and expectation on alot of drivers, but perhaps no more so then on Flouncy.  Some would argue that with better reliability the fight with Lambo might have been closer last season, but alas it wasn't to be.  We look now at how season two unfolded.<br /> <br /> The Bahrain opener would be a clear indication of Flouncy's intentions comfortably taking pole by 4 tenths over Lambo, and controlling the race from start to finish, leading last years team mate Lambo over the line with a comfortable 36 second gap.  Lambo's new team mate Kikz would round out the top three, giving Force India the first double podium finish of the season.<br /> <br /> Qualifying in Australia was marred with bad weather, with rain interrupting the qualifying.  As it started to dry out times started to tumble with Lambo taking the last possible opportunity to bolt on intermediate tires and set a quick lap securing maiden pole of the season by one tenth.  However it was not to be with the tricky conditions causing problems for most drivers, it would be Ghost who would prove to be untouchable in the wet and post his sixth carer victory for Lotus Racing.  Flouncy and Lambo rounding off the podium.<br /> <br /> Round three the competition headed to Sepang where it's mixture of tight twisty low speed corners and two long straights making overpassing possible.  Weather would always play a part here and qualifying was no different with rain affecting proceedings.  Flouncy was able to find a good balance clocking a best time some 1.2 seconds quicker than the Force India of Kikz and register his second pole position of the year.  Race day would prove to be dry and the finishing order of qualifying didn't change throughout the race.  Mansill leading home Kikz with the Lotus of Ghost rounding out the podium.<br /> <br /> The Atomic F1 circus headed to China for the fourth round of the championship where Lotus driver Ghost would cement his title of 'wet weather specialist' with a stunning win in wet from third on the grid.  Qualifying would be dry affair and once again Flouncy would prove that his domination of the fly away races would continue with a huge 7 tenths gap to second place Mark in the sister McLaren followed by the Lotus of Ghost.  However rain is the great equalizer in F1 and Ghost would prove supreme in the testing conditions registering his second win of the season and cementing himself as a true title contender.<br /> <br /> Catalunya would be the first of the European races where Force India's Lambo hoped would prove to be the turning point in his championship charge.  Qualifying was dry and it proved to be very competitive with the top 4 drivers separate by less than 6 tenths of a second.  The fight came down to Force India's Lambo and McLarens Flouncy with the final margin less than 6 one hundredths of a second with Lambo nudging out his second pole of the season.  The Lotus of Ghost and the second Force India of Kikz would round out the top four.  Race day would be largely uneventful with a good controlled win by Lambo leading home Flouncy with Ghost rounding out the podium.  The top 4 cars however being only separated by 35 seconds in the end.<br /> <br /> Monaco would prove to be the turning point in the championship battle for Lambo.  Torro Rossos Fredzfrog would steal all the headlines destroying his car on the first lap of qualifying forcing his garage into a long night as they put the car back together for the race.  Having secured his 3rd pole position on the historic street circuit by an incredible 1.4 seconds external factors would see that front row change to the second row with a 3rd place start.  It would prove to be a catalyst for a first corner tangle with the Torro Rosso of Fredzfrog.  Struggling with front end damage a good recovery drive would see him secure second, but not before the McLaren of Flouncy taking a comfortable victory.  Flouncy taking home his 3rd win of the season.<br /> <br /> Round 7 at Istanbul would prove to be the closest pole shootout of the season with all 5 top drivers within 8 tenths of each other.  Once again a strong qualifying result from Lambo taking his 3rd consecutive pole over Ghost by half a second with Flouncy and Kikz rounding out the top 4.  However a horror race start and poor pace would prove to be fatal and Flouncy would cruise to victory recording his 2nd consecutive win, and 4th win of the season.  A solid drive from Ghost would see a well deserved podium as well as pole sitter Lambo rounding out the podium in 3rd.<br /> <br /> It would be a make or break Canadian Grand Prix for Force India as Lambo recorded his 4th consecutive pole position but so far only being able to convert one of those into race victory so far this season.  The Force India was exceptionally strong around the Gilles Velleneuve circuit with both cars on the front row of the grid with the Lotus of Ghost and McLaren of Flouncy rounding out the top 2 rows.  A solid start by the front grid would see the first 5 laps fairly uneventful, however lap 6 would see a spin by Lambo resulting in what would look like another wasted opportunity, however solid race pace and good pit stop would see Lambo cruise to his 2nd victory of the season and the 2nd 1-2 finish for Force India with Flouncy rounding out the podium.  A solid 4th from the Lotus of Ghost following home the second of the McLarens of Mark.<br /> <br /> The run of pole positions for Lambo would come to a close as Ghost would post Lotus Racings first pole position of the season with a dominate display in Valencia pipping the McLaren of Flouncy by 6 tenths.  Force India's Lambo and Kikz would round out the send row.  A good half a second and second off the pace of Ghost.  However as it has in the past wet weather would play a crucial role.  The race would begin wet and a stunning start from Lambo would see him catapult up to first on the first corner as the tricky conditions caused both the Lotus of Ghost and the McLaren of Flouncy to run wide into the first turn.  However you can never discount Ghost in the wet and a mistake by Lambo on lap 8 would have the two drivers running neck and neck.  As the rain eased the slicks were clearly the way to go as Lambo would pit on lap 9 switching to the option tire, which in itself was a gamble with quite a few laps to go having to make them last.  Flouncy switched to the prime tire which would definitely last the race distance, but would be slower during it's first few laps.  However the gamble payed off with Lambo bringing home the Force India in front of the fast finishing Flouncy.  Lambo racking up his 3rd victory of the season and his second consecutive race win.  Ghost's Lotus and Force India's Kikz would round out the top 4.<br /> <br /> Tricky conditions would meet drivers for qualifying for the British Grand Prix with wet weather once again proving to be difficult to pin a good lap.  Again choosing the right tire at the right time proved critical as once again Lambo would put the Force India on pole switching to option tires for a last final lap and getting pole by half a second over team mate Kikz with Ghost once again proving his might in wet weather putting the Lotus ahead of McLaren's Flouncy.  A good start and some close racing would see the top 3 switch places a number of times in the first 9 laps.  Lap 10 would see all the top 3 come into the pits, clearly tho Lambo couldn't find a good rhythm on the hard tires and struggled for race pace as Mark made a stunning pass into turn one to steal 4th.  Silverstone would prove to be another favourite as Flouncy posted his 5th race victory and cement his place at the top of the championship table. Ghost once again proving consistency is just as important as sheer pace placed second with Force India's Kikz rounding out the podium.<br /> <br /> Germany would prove to be a close qualifying tussle between Lotus's Ghost, Force India's Lambo and McLarens Flouncy.  Less than 2 tenths would separate the trio on the qualifying run.  Ghost making the most of his options pipping Lambo and Flouncy to pole.  Controversy would strike on the tight high speed section of turn 9 as Flouncy attempted a pass on Lambo, neither driver yielding and contact was made, causing damage to the front wing of Lambo.  The ensuing damage forcing an early pit stop for the primes.  Ghost in the mean time had pulled a comfortable gap and was able to cruise to victory leading home Flouncy and Force India's Lambo.  It was Ghost's third win of the season equalling Lambo's efforts, but still trailing behind McLaren's Flouncy with 5 wins.<br /> <br /> With the controversy of Germany still running hot, F1 moved to the Hungaroring in Budapest for round 12.  Close qualifying again sees Flouncy on pole by 2 tenths ahead of rival Lambo and Mark close behind.  A flying start by Mark would see him overtake Lambo into turn one, however running wide out of the same turn Flouncy's McLaren rejoining the track made contact dropping his team mate back and allowing Lambo's Force India to to regain 2nd place.  The ensuring battle over the next few laps would see the lead switch a number of times between the ex team mates pitted eventually on lap 9 as both pitted, a quicker pit stop by the McLaren garage saw the Force India come out 2nd.  However it would not be the end of the problems for the Force India driver as he was forced to pit again a few laps later with a front puncture losing out another place to Mark.  The ensuing battle as Lambo on his fresher tires was able to steal 3rd place, while up the front Flouncy cruised to this 6th race win of the year equalling the number of wins Lambo had when he took out the championship.  Once again a sold race from Ghost holding onto second and keep Flouncy honest just 13 seconds down the road.<br /> <br /> If there are two things that go hand in hand for Spa it's rain and more rain.  And qualifying was no different as the rain yet again provided a challenge to the drivers.  In trying conditions it would be Force India's Kikz who would outshine team mate Lambo to pip him to pole by 2 tenths.  Flouncy and Ghost rounding out the 2nd row.  Eyes clearly on Ghost who as from previous races fancied his chances in the rain.  A first corner incident with Lambo and Torro Rosso's fredzfrog would see the Force India drop to the back of the field, however in perhaps his finest drive of the season Lambo would make his way through the field with the highlight a solid pass on Flouncy into campus corner.  Chasing down Ghost who at this stage had build up a large lead Lambo made a pass on a drying track to take the lead.  With a track that was clearly ready for slicks Lambo pitted from the lead letting Ghost back through choosing to keep going on his wets despite his pitwall requesting he come in.  With his wets completely destroyed Lambo was able to take the lead back with several laps to go.  McLaren's Flouncy having also stopped for slicks was now chasing down 2nd place Ghost who on very worn tires was lapping very slowly and eventually unable to hold off as Flouncy crossed the line ahead of Ghost.  Lambo posted his 4th win of the season and kept the possibility of a championship alive.<br /> <br /> It was clear now leading into Round 14 of the season that two title contenders where fighting it out.  Last years champion Force India's Lambo and his ex team mate McLaren's Flouncy would battle it out again for pole.  Lambo's strong qualifying this year would continue beating Flouncy by just 2 one hundredths of a second.  The second McLaren of Mark would put his car just ahead of Lotus's Ghost filling out the top two grids.  A solid race start would see a drag race into turn one as Lambo missed the breaking zone and had to take the short cut into turn one.  On lap 3 breaking into the same corner the Force India driver dropped one to many gears and spun leaving the Flouncy's McLaren to take the lead.  However shortly two laps later the McLaren drifted onto the grass out of the second lesmo and the nearly collided with the Force India coming through.  After that incident it was a relatively straight forward race with Lambo taking the comfortable victory posting his 5th victory, and second consecutive race win.  Lotus would score yet another podium with Ghost crossing the line in 3rd and McLaren's Mark rounding out the top 4.<br /> <br /> Round 15 would see us almost cement Flouncy's first championship with a measured and controlled drive by the McLaren driver.  Lambo would again rue misfortune having yet again put his Force India on pole but not be able to follow up with a win.  Flouncy would be beaten to pole by half a second, but like all street circuits keeping it out of the wall would prove to be a challenge.  Turn one would once again prove chaotic with Flouncy sneaking up the inside of turn one pushing Lambo slightly wide, giving the sister McLaren of Mark an opportunity to go through as well.  However a tap from behind would see the Force India forced to the back of the field.  From then on it was a controlled race with Flouncy recording his 7th win of the season to set a new record for wins in a season.  Lotus's Ghost once again proved consistent having recovered from down the field after the first corner incident to claim second.  The second McLaren of Mark would round out the podium.With all but the glimmer of hope of retaining the championship, Lambo would need an almost DNF from Flouncy to have any hope of going back to back, and clearly Japan was not going to be an easy task.  McLaren's Flouncy was sublime posting a pole position time that was nearly 2 seconds faster than second place Kikz in the Forice India.  The second McLaren of Mark would pip the Lotus of Ghost by only 3 tenths to round out the top four.  With such a domination of qualifying it was clear Flouncy was the driver to beat, but no one did and Flouncy claimed his 8th win, as well as his first championship title.  Team mate Mark would round out a 1-2 finish for the team with Virgin Racing's Sora scoring the teams first podium, as well as his best finish to date.<br /> <br /> With the championship over it was only about pride now, and it was clear that perhaps with the pressure of the title now off McLaren's Flouncy could relax as the pole shootout was clearly a battle between Flouncy's team mate Mark and Force India's Lambo.  With only 2 minutes remaining Mark had the better of Lambo beating him pole by only 3 tenths.  Ghost and Flouncy would round out the top 4.  A shocking start by Lambo off the line saw both Flouncy and the Virgin of Sora get past on the opening corner.  Lambo was lucky not to lose a front wing as the Virgin nearly lost it out of turn two.  However as both Sora and Flouncy overshot turn 3 Lambo was able to make his way past Flouncy.  Within the same lap a great move on the outside of turn 7 gave back the 2nd place lost to the start.  The ensuing battle as the Force India followed the gear box of the McLaren went on for a number of laps before on Lap 9 Mark pitted, leaving the Force India driver to put in a gap to try and come out in front.  A great inlap and pit stop allowed the Force India to come just out in from of the McLaren, however on new cold tires that weren't up to temperature Mark was able to make the pass into turn 3.  For the next several laps the Force India looked for ways to pass but it wasn't until a mistake into turn 7 cost Mark not only the lead but also second place as the Lotus of Ghost passed as well.  It should have been a cruise to victory as Lambo maintained a solid gap to second place Ghost.  But a critical error on lap 21 saw that lead cut to nothing as Ghost was all over the back of the Force India.  Into the final last turns a small tap from behind shot Lambo wide and gave Ghost the chance to pass, crossing the line only 3 tenths in front of Lambo.  Lambo rueing the mistake and Ghost ecstatic over his 3rd victory of the year.  Mark despite his error only 15 seconds behind rounding out the podium.  It would also mark the end of an incredible 16 consecutive podiums for Flouncy.<br /> <br /> The second final in Brazil while irrelevant in the title battle would see yet again one of the closest qualifying sessions ever with the top 5 drivers separated by 7 tenths only.  It would by McLaren's Flouncy beating the Lotus of Ghost to pole, with Mark and Lambo rounding out the top 4.  Most notable improvement front the back field team of Torro Rosso as Fredzfrog put his car within 2 seconds of the lead time.  The weather would play a big part as heavy rain met the drivers for the start of the race.  Almost all drivers went off at some stage and it seemed a case of survival rather than sheer speed.  The track did dry with a few laps remaining but too little too late as Flouncy would go on to record his 9th and final win of the year.  Ghost once again proving that he's a master in wet conditions, and a solid race from Mark in the sister McLaren rounded out the top 3.<br /> <br /> The final round in Abu Dhabi saw the first 75% race, and considering that's 41 laps would prove physically the toughest race of the year on drivers.  The Force India drivers were very quick around the 5.5KM circuit with Lambo pipping team mate Kikz by only 3 tenths.  McLaren's Mark a further half a second behind Kikz with Ghost rounding out the front two grids.  A clean start by both the Force India's saw close racing.  While team orders would have been clearly to give each other space, both raced each other hard.  Lambo was the first to pit on lap 13 with Kikz hoping to leapfrog him pitting one lap later, however a steering issue forced the Force India to call of any hopes of a decent result.  The rest of the race turning into a testing session.  From then on it was a controlled race till the end, but even so the Force India clearly very fast around the track winning by a massive 57 seconds.  Lambo would claim his 6th win of the year, but would rue a number of races and chances of beating rival Flouncy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Championship Standings:</strong><br /> Flouncy 466<br /> Lambo 411<br /> Ghost 383<em><strong><br /> </strong></em></p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Now the season is done, our expert panel has voted and here are the results.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most improved driver</strong> - Ghost<br /> A close battle with both Fredzfrog and Ghost, it would be the stunning drives in the wet and his 4 race victories that would nudge him ahead of the vastly improved frog.<br /> Give him the right team and Ghost could well be fighting for a championship next season.<br /> <br /> <strong>Personality of the season</strong> - Fredfrog<br /> There are few people who can plow into a wall at 66G's so spectacularly and frequently as Fredzfrog.  Unanimous in result, the Torro Rosso driver was easily the most entertaining driver of the year.  Fast on the improvement however we can see big things in Season 3.<br /> <br /> <strong>Best qualifier of the season</strong> - Lambo<br /> Perhaps the Mark Webber of qualifying, Lambo put his Force India on pole 9 times this season, however of those 9, only 4 were converted into race victories.  With better luck more would be expected next season.<br /> <br /> <strong>Drive of the season</strong> - Ghost<br /> In perhaps his finest drive of the season Lotus driver Ghost proved that he is up there with the masters when it comes to handling wet weather.  Punching above his weight in Melbourne he drove a flawless race to record his 4th carer victory in difficult conditions.  One to watch for in season 3.<br /> <br /> <strong>Best team of the season</strong> - Lotus<br /> This one was always going to be close, but many didn't expect this result.  While it has to be said the constructors champions would always be in the mix, the small one man outfit at Lotus showed us what really being in a team of one was all about.  There's no question that given the right team mate Ghost will be tough to beat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Best race of the season</strong> - British Grand Prix<br /> A pivotal round that had everything going, mixed weather, close racing and exciting finish.  A race that was extremely close and exciting to witness.<br /> <br /> <strong>Worst race of the season</strong> - Monaco Grand Prix<br /> It would seem that putting a wall right next to the racing track is a bad idea, and it appears most drivers agree.  Despite it's heritage and sentimentality Monaco has been voted by the drivers as the worst GP of the season.  This seasons race was highlighted with a DNF in qualifying, a number of lost front wings and an exorbitant number of pits.  Perhaps season 3 will result in a happier ending.<br /> <br /> <strong>Best driver of the season</strong> - Flouncy<br /> I don't think there was much doubt on who was the best all rounder this season.  Consistency and speed taking 9 wins, and 16 podiums on the way to his first championship.  Dominated the fly away races with 2 wins and 2 2nd's it took till round 8 just to score a 3rd place.  With a worst result of 4th at round 17 at Korea perhaps we have seen the highest score by a driver.  Time will tell.  Perhaps the Vettel of our time once he's at the front he generally stays there with perhaps the best pole to win conversion so far.  Will there be more glory to come?</p>]]></content>

<p><strong>Flouncy - Red Bull</strong><br /> Speed and track affinity, plus improved consistency and overall race pace along with ongoing qualifying capacity puts the Flounce high on bookies lists.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>Ghost - Lotus</strong><br /> Through season 2 Ghost 'kept the bastards honest', always threatening and, on increasing occasion, taking the big points. Could season 3 be his championship season?<br /> <br /> The man is highly rated in traffic, rarely makes errors and possesses a relentless head of steam that never gives anyone ahead of him a chance to relax.<br /> <br /> Ghost can sit on your tail for a dozen laps, if you're in peak form that is. Otherwise any weakness he senses is soon pounced upon. Given the chance he's past and away.<br /> <br /> Ghost is the god king of wet weather racing.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lambo - Renault</strong><br /> Fusing highly refined technical skills with pile-driving race pace, Lambo rarely, if ever, makes a mistake when in clean air. On rare occasion prone to<br /> pressure from behind, Lambo nevertheless is expected to put in a supreme performance in the season 3 season and is determined to push for his second championship.<br /> <br /> Poor starts in some season 2 races were costly, though Lambo is able to come back from situations that would sink other drivers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fredzfrog - Torro Rosso</strong><br /> After putting in some solid performances in season 2, showing real growth and impressing with occasionally blistering qualifying speed, the fredz is expected to run highly in the upper half of the grid in this, his graduation year.<br /> <br /> <strong>Kikz - McLaren</strong><br /> Responsibilities as the manager of his own family F1 team, as well as wavering commitment to the iRacing series has prevented kikz from showing the commitment to make him a contender in season 2.<br /> <br /> When he does get his focus on, kikz can be a devestatingly fast driver, putting in qualifying lap pace in a race, though not usually during actual qualifying. Consistency has been his big question mark in the past.<br /> <br /> With old pal bobaj0r back on the track kikz is expected to show renewed passion for F1 and is expected to appear frequently on the podiium.<br /> <br /> <strong>bobaj0r - Ferrari</strong><br /> Fast straight out of the box in season 1, bobaj0r mysteriously disappeared during season 2.<br /> <br /> Without the benefit of F1 experience that matches other racers, can boba find his mojo quickly and scythe up the field early enough to bank valuable opening round championship points?<br /> <br /> <strong>Bollum</strong><br /> A mid field prospect who could run high or low in the field, depending on how things go.<br /> <br /> <strong>nobody813</strong><br /> This sponsored driver could surprise many with raw natural speed. Mostly it is hoped that first corner etiquette is high on his list of talents.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hulkster - Williams</strong><br /> Out of retirement, the former V8 Supercars force could shock many in the glamour world of F1. Capable of great speed, consistency and trash talk, the Hulks has the coolest team HQ on the field.<br /> <br /> With plenty of race experience, Hulks is expected to soon slot into competitive traffic conditions and display smooth safe driving.<br /> <br /> <strong>MacDude</strong><br /> Another sponsored driver, Mac Dude is a complete unknown but could surprise many. Not expected to rack up early podiums, Mac Dude nevertheless joins a handful of rookies in the Season 3 lineup, putting him in a good position to drive for midfield points.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>After a season on the sidelines Williams F1 announced today they are back with the signing of their newest driver for season 3. Team principal Sir Frank Williams had this to say. "We are exceptionaly proud to announce that hulkster will be leading our championship charge for season 3. He's a raw tallent that I'm sure will grow over the season. And since we are about the same age, we have alot in common." Williams Technical director Sam Michael was upbeat about the teams chances. "I know he's old and smells like an obese mans twosies, but he's also fast and very cheap. We just have to make sure we get him back to the retirement village before 4.30 for bed."</p>

<p>Hulkster while inexperinced in F1 did cut his teeth in open wheel racing in his younger years, taking several state and national 'penny farthing open wheel' championships.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[The F1 circus returns after the autumn break.  Have the lagging teams made up ground?  Will McLaren close the gap to the two top teams, or will Group Force India and their superstars continue to runaway?]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/762/73170845_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="f1 tyres" style="float: right;"/></p>
<p>The return to racing after the Autumn break is nearly upon us.  This weekend sees the circus move north to the Asia double, Malaysia and China.</p>
<p>In Season 2 World Champion Flouncy set a blistering qualifying pace to sit comfortably on pole from TurrbalTerror, with a Vettel-esque 1.2 seconds over the feild.  Flouncy led from start to finish, completely unchallenged, while the rest of the pack slugged it out for the other podium slots.  </p>
<p>If testing pace is anything to go by, this seasons race is looking much more competitive, with TurrbalTerror setting a time in practice the Mclaren team reports as 'a significant amount' faster than last years pole time of 1:36.264.  How much time did the other teams find is the unknown and with times tumbling season after season, even a significant improvement may not be enough to get pole.  If anyone is likely to do it this year it's TurrbalTerror, the current top qualifier for Season 3.</p>
<p>HRT also promises massive speed increases and it's expected Hulks will make his belated F1 debut, after missing the opening two rounds through illness.  MacDude's HRT is reported to sport an updated steering mechanism bringing the HRT into line with the other cars on the grid and hopefully both improve MacDudes own performances and save the runoff areas from excessive wear.</p>
<p>Malaysia is shaping to be an exciting race with an expectedly close battle between Flouncy and HolyGhost79 for the race win.  In following with events in the opening races, TurrbalTerror will sit on pole and be nudged off the track by Flouncy in the opening laps, to eventually finish forth.  The unknown element is the evergreen Atomic Lambo.  Will he turn around his Season 2 form and be a race win challenger or will he struggle to match the two fastest men this season.  </p>
<p>Whatever happens it will be exciting.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Which real world F1 driver inspires you most: Juan Pablo Montoya, Michael Andretti or Luca Badoer, and why?</strong><br />While I respect Montoya for his amazing tennis ability, I draw my inspiration from Luca Badoer.  In Luca we have a driver who is a perennial under achiever.  When he finally got his shot at a Ferrari race drive, some 100 years after his F1 debut he qualified so far off the pace it embarrassed even the slowest cars on the grid.  Yet he didn't give up.  He kept trying to race and continue to go round.  It's that self belief, flying in the face of reality that gives me hope that one day I may become world champion.  I salute you Luca.<br /><br /><strong>Turn 1 presents tremendous challenges to novice drivers, what safety tips can you give these noobs to help prevent ruinous disasters?</strong><br />Pay Flouncy off so he won't hit you.<br /><br /><strong>When starting a race, do you have a plan?</strong><br />I belive the best drivers don't need a plan.  They can rely on instinct, feel, and a bit of magic.  My race engineers and I usually work through Saturday night at each race, comging up with a plan whereby I can position my car in the way of any fast approaching cars come turn 1.<br /><br /><strong>If a cute, happy and innocent small child asks for an autograph straight after a race do you:</strong><br />A. Tell him to fuck off<br />B. Ask him if he's a qualified gearbox engineer, and if not, why is he in your face?<br />--&gt;C. Look for his Mum and rate her.&lt;---<br /><br /><strong>How do you balance disappointing your fans with dissapointing your sponsors?</strong><br /><strong>I have fans?</strong><br />Post-race, when you're finally alone in your elite F1 superstar trailer do you:<br />A. Beat off furiously in anger<br />B. Smack your bitch, then beat off furiously<br />--&gt;C. Lay some pipe with the fan milfs&lt;--<br />D. Call eddie Irvine and agree with everything he says<br />E. Present your lawyers with fresh opportunities for litigation<br /><br /><strong>Evergreen Lambo claims 'victim of circumstance' after a race and blames you for some dumb shit, your response is to:</strong><br />A. Head down and get on with the next race.<br />--&gt;B: A bit of elbow to face diplomacy<br />--&gt;C: Blame Flouncy<br />--&gt;D: Take the cunt out on turn 1 next race<br /><br /><strong>A member of an opposing team has been given the opportunity to interview you and wrecks it by casting nasty aspersions about your track talents. Do you:</strong><br />--&gt;A. Take him out at turn 1 next race <br />B: Ignore him cos he's a dick<br />C: Prove them all wrong by winning<br /><br /><strong>What's your favorite track and why?</strong><br />A drag stip.  Less chance for Flouncy to punt me off.<br /><br /><strong>What tracks do you hate and why?</strong><br />Tracks with corners.  More chance for Flouncy to punt me off.</p>]]></content>

<p>The Season 3 Spainish atomic F1 GP at Catalunya in the beautiful city of Barcelona is looking like a one horse race.  Season 2 race winner Atomic Lambo will be out to recapture some of the form that won him the Season 1 world champsionship and there few better circuits than Barcelona for him to do this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Catalunya is a super smooth track that works brilliantly with a finely tuned aero-kit, as is on board the Force India.  The smooth driving style of Lambo should see him capture pole position and drive a consistently fast race to take the flag.  Atomic Lambo isn’t the only driver in the race though and current points leader HolyGhost79 will be out to take yet another win and consolidate his lead in the championship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Atomicf1 interviewed Season 1 winner and Mclaren driver TurrbalTerror to get his thoughts on the upcoming race.  “If Lambo thinks he’s going to have it all his way, he’s got it all wrong.  The boys at the McLaren factory have been working day and night to build me a car that will withstand the rigours of a high impact Flouncy hit.  With a stronger tub and my  recent practice times, I’m gunning for my first race win of the season” said the much underrated driver.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The battle for Season 3 championship honours intensifies with a close points table and the probable appearance of a new HRT driver, Hulkster, now that teams funding has been stabilised.  McLaren also expect bobaj0r to come back from his pre-season tennis injury to help take points from the other non-McLaren drivers.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>atomicf1.com interviewed the two atomicf1 world champions, Flouncy and Atomic Lambo, on their thoughts and chances in the upcoming race this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Flouncy</strong></p>
<p>Catalunya: </p>
<p>For sure, Spain is a track that can give you position as quickly as it takes it away. There are many legitimate and exciting overtaking opportunities coming from every chance -- whether out-braking going into a corner, through the fast corners themselves, and out of them if exit speed is good.</p>
<p>It's as much a technical track as it is one that rewards hot 'seat of pants' aggro driving. I love the dive into the swooping, sweeping turn 1, incredibly exciting stuff.</p>
<p>Catalunya can reward an unusually varied strategy of setups, with both low and high downforce effective here. This is one track I'd really love to see what setups other drivers are running.</p>
<p>I think the track favours our car so I expect a good podium position, along with my team mate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monaco: </p>
<p>After last season's win at Monaco I'm full of beans going in. Lambo and I have a traditional rivalry here going back through the history of the sport. Technically it's his turn this season, but I'll be doing all I can to make it two in a row for myself.</p>
<p>The reality though is that it's a bit of a lottery, especially if it's wet. A spun car -- especially at Massanet -- and especially on lap 1, can dictate the race outcome depending on who is in front and who is behind the jammed car.</p>
<p>Patience, concentration and luck are the keys to Monaco. It's an exhausting race and if you're not in the zone from the green light you're not in the running.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Atomic Lambo</strong></p>
<p>For sure I was strong here last season so for sure I'll be looking to be strong again at Catalyuna. For sure it's always difficult because the Red Bull team for sure will be hard to beat, but for sure I have have high expectations going into the European races. For sure.</p>
<p>Last season was very dissapointing considering the strong pace I had in qualifying and the contact with Fredz into the first corner. But my package is very confident around Monte Carlo circuit. I hope to go one better than season 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there you have it folks, as predicted these two rounds of the atomicf1 championship are going to be very interesting, as arguably the two finest drivers in the world today duke it out for supremacy at F1's resident test track and the crown jewel of the championship.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Driver quotes from Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, and TurrbalTerror]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flouncy</strong><br />One of my fav tracks. Lovely speedy go kart track. Nothing to tell, got pole, got away, Lambo was a few lengths back for a couple of laps, then he disappeared to be replaced by kikz. I had a comfy lead so just maintained pace, turned the engine down and drove to preserve tires. Eventually kikz disappeared so I just cruised around quickly and cleanly. Apart from a slight twitch on turn 1 lap 1 that I caught, a flawless drive.<br /><br /><strong>Atomic Lambo</strong><br />I would vote this and China as the most technical tracks in the calander. Sepang Has at least 3 or 4 very very technical corners that if you don't get right you lose lap time. Any how qualifying I went out early and banked a hot lap. It was solid but not fast, there was easly another 6 tenths or more to get from it. I went out on a second set of tires and was up 5 tenths in the first sector alone when I caught up to Mac dude which was unfortunate because I think that would have been a very hot lap. There was not enough time to pit and put another set on so I went out and tried on the same set. Unfortunately not as much grip as it had on the opening lap and only went up about 3 tenths on my time. Had to settle for 3rd on the grid, but easly could have been 2nd and might have troubled Ben for pole. The race I had a good start off the line. Went into the first corner right on the gearbox of Ben. Ben made a small mistake out of turn one and nearly lost it but did well to hold onto it. Going into turn 3 I breaked to turn in and Bollum comes flying out of nowhere taking me off the track. I resumed just behind Bollum and fast starting Fredz. Turn 4 fredz went off, and into turn 5 bollum took a strange line and I made a solid pass on him. I spent the next 3 odd laps catching up to Ben which I did. However on turn 9 turning into the corner, Kikz hit me and I lost the place. Not sure how you thought there was room to do that or if you out breaked yourself but it came from no where. I resumed in 3rd but had Ghost all over me. Going intot the final corner I got tagged but still ok, but on the next lap got tagged again and spun. However in a show of great sportsman ship Ghost waited till I resumed and allowed me to take my place, and in my opinion based on the finishing times, probably easily cost him victory. I made a mistake on the next lap that put ghost back infront of me anyway. I followed for another 2 laps and we both pitted on lap 8 or 9 with me right behind Ghost. Must have been a quick pitstop as I then came out ahead of him. But I struggled on the hard tires for a lap or two and eventually he passed me when I made a mistake. From then on it was a lonely race. Ghost obviously with that delay of 15 odd seconds letting me through and then the delay in the pits probably might have cost him. Overall a dissapointing result considering the early laps.<br /><br /><strong>TurrbalTerror</strong><br />Malaysia was interesting. I went faster in qualifying practice than I did in multiplayer mode. Not sure way. I wouldn't have got pole. I probably still would have been fourth with a mid 1:35, but I just couldn't do it. The first 5 or 6 laps were fantastic. I got off the line decentish and followed Ghost into the turn but he slowed rather drastically and I think someone tapped him. I took it pretty easy through the first few turns, so as not to trip up, and was 6th through those first. By the time I got the end of the lap I was a close 4th with Ghost right in front. I felt I had a lot more speed and was keeping up easily. Not sure what happened to ghost. I think he ran wide. Anyway, I took my opportunity and closed up behind Lambo and Flouncy not far ahead. I was glued to Lambo's gearbox on through turns 7 and 8. Coming in to T9 I took my chance and stuck my nose up the inside. Lambo turned in and I hit him. My fault. After that I took caught up behind Flouncy give or take a second or two. Pit stops came a few laps later and I pitted first I think. I came out in fourth again but got second back after the pitstops were done. Ghost started catching me pretty quickly at about lap 15 and I defended my line. Not sure when the pass was made or why, but Ghost took off after that and I settled for the bottom of the podium. My first this year.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Driver quotes from Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, TurrbalTerror]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flouncy</strong><br />This track always seems like work, still nice with a cool blend of fast variable throttle corners. You really need to manage the throttle so carefully on several corners here...<br /><br />Had a good start off the line and Lambo right in front of me didn't. I had enough speed on him to be at least side by side turning into turn 1, if not past him, but the cheeky bugger saw this and moved to block me, had to lift off... s'alright, I would have done the same thing.<br /><br />Then it was kikz blazing ahead, ghost, lambo and me. A couple of laps in on turn 1 I was following Lambo and he went a bit wide while my line is to follow the curb in the last part, so in a flash I was inside Lambo - it wasn't an overtaking move, just found myself there in a blink of an eye, I did brake to slow and get behind you safely but you turned back in too quickly and we touched. Sorry about that, wasn't going for a move there...<br /><br />A couple of laps later I tapped kikz, you went invisible right as I was close and I couldn't tell where you were. That hardly happens so unsure why the game decided to do that. In any case I tapped you, so sorry about that.<br /><br />Then it was me and ghosty, I had the lead for a good while and he was enough car lengths behind to give me comfort, but threaten me all the time. I went wide on that bloody second last corner (end of the epic straight - you know, the place that costs you races...) and he was by. I stayed behind for a while til he pulled away a football field length.<br /><br />Last few laps I was safely in 2nd enough to really take risks and push, engine on fast and went all out. Seemed to close a bit but not enough, til last couple of laps all of a sudden I was on him. Not quite enough to challenge, though fredz positioned himself nicely on the second last corner right between us, but alas it didn't help me.</p>
<p><br /><br /><strong>Lambo</strong><br />Shaghai is also a pet hate. Not because it's technical, which it is, has a similar first corner chain that you need to get right to get the best drive out of the second bend, but because it's bumpy. So bumpy. Especially the back straight corner, really hard to get a good setup. Had a decent qualifying lap, but lack of practice this week really hurt me as I did probably 2 or 3 more laps then I would have liked. I had a badish start. Got of the line ok but I knew ben starting in 4th would be behind me on the grid, and If I've learned anything from Singapore...and Korea....and Melbourne....he'll attack the inside. Getting off the line I short shifted 3rd but deliberately parked my car on the very inside to deny Ben the chance of going up the inside (you never got beside me Ben, if you had, youd be in the wall). Kikz had a monster start. While I was busy defending Ben I forgot about him and he navigated around the outside of me, and then the inside of Ghost. Looked very good on the replay. Next lap or so Ben chased me but into the first corner I took a wider line as to have the inside going into the second corner, but had contact with Ben. I havn't seen the replay yet, but it was quite a shunt and sent me spinning. From then on it was a lonely race in 4th. Overall a dissapointing round. While I made mistakes I lost chunks of time to incidents that didn't fell were my fault. But with the fly races done thankfully, we have two tracks comeing up which I do love. Catalyuna and Monaco. Hope to do better at Monaco considering the disspoaintment of last season.</p>
<p><br /><strong>TurrbalTerror</strong><br />China was ok. I had good qualifying speed and could was close. Closer than Sepang anyway. I really enjoy the first few turns and I think I've always done exceptionally well there. I got into first place from the start and led for the first 6-7 laps Ghost start to mount an effort. We battled closely, with me actively defending lines. We had an both had an off on the hairpin after the straight as I took the inside line and he went left. Ghost was probably being polite and not turning in on me. I missed my break point being too concerned with defending and would have certainly hit Ghost if he turned in. I managed to get back on track still in the lead but Flouncy was close behind. He came up in the inside in turn 1 and I got tapped sending me off into the sand to jump a few curbs. Not too bad. I was about 4-5 second back and in 3rd when I got on track. A few laps later Fredzfrog was off on the same turn and as he joined the track he also joined my sidepod. no damage but again an off and a few more seconds lost. I made an error on 6 for 4 consecutive laps near the end, when Bollum was close behind. In the end I cruised into a comfortable 3rd.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>It was clear from the outset of the Spanish Atomic F1 GP that the majority of the teams and drivers had been practicing this track.  Lines were tidy and times were low.  Spain saw the re-introduction of Season 1 racer bobaj0r, returning from his stint in NASCAR to join the cast of regulars.</p>
<p>Qualifying was pretty much as expected with Flouncy taking first place from TurrbalTerror, HolyGhost79, Atomic Lambo, bobabj0r, OriginalBollum, Fredzfrog and a rapidly improving BreakerMorant.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As the pack left the start grid it appeared someone had forgot to tell TurrbalTerror there was a race on, as he stood on the grid while all but Mac Dude drove around him.  TurrbalTerror later reported a clutch problem on his Mclaren. After the first few laps TurrbalTerror had regained ground.  Having dispatched Fredzfrog and OriginalBollum by turn 4 of lap 1 he stuck to the back of bobaj0r and Atomic Lambo while Ghost and Flouncy opened a small gap.  A few laps in and Atomic Lambo had a slip on the astro-turf, letting bobaj0r go and TurrbalTerror go past.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerror caught up to Flouncy, where they battled for a few laps, exchanging places as each pushed the other a little too hard.  On lap 8 TurrbalTerror spun on the final corner and damaged his front wing, immediately pitting for repairs.</p>
<p>Both Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror pushed hard to catch the leading pack and both spun on a number of occasions, eventually settling for 4<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> places respectively.</p>
<p>Final Race results saw HolyGhost lead Flouncy, TurrbalTerror, Atomic Lambo, bobaj0r, OriginalBollum, FredzFrog, and BreakerMorant</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>We know whenever we go to Monte Carlo we're going to witness a display of ultimate car control and application of brake and throttle at the hands of Monaco specialist Atomic Lambo.   His laps of Monaco rival the great Ayrton Senna for his ability to find the edge then push past it.  The qualifying time demonstrated this and embarrassed other "fast" drivers, including the current championship leader HolyGhost79.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>The last two grand prix held at Istanbul Park have had the same podium and there's little to indicate this race will be any different.  In both races, Flouncy, HolyGhost79, and Atomic Lambo have occupied the top three spots, with current fourth place in the championship, TurrbalTerror 6th and 5th. </p>
<p>It is expect that pole position will be fought out between HolyGhost79 and Flouncy with 2nd row of the grid occupied by Atomic Lambo and bobaj0r.  Spirits are high at Group Force India after recent success and a convinving lead in the constructors championship.  Their latest addition to the steering and front end geometery on the #1 car will only help Flouncy in his quest for his second pole positition of the year.</p>
<p>Toward the less experienced end of the grid, Mac Dude is showing impressive improvements and is already raising eyebrows further up the grid as those teams look to seek new blood to improve their prospects. </p>
<p>One such team is McLaren, who are reportedly unhappy with the performance of TurrbalTerror and looking to promote bobaj0r to team leader and offload TurrbalTerror for season 4.  Things don't look good in the TurrbalTerror camp, as raw pace is not being converted to race points, through poor car control and setup decisions.</p>]]></content>

<p>The Season 3 atomicf1 Turkish GP was a close fought affair from the outset, and with the top qualifiers separated by less than a second the indicators were there early. </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="11" />
<p> </p>
<p>The first corner was not without incident, as pole sitter bobaj0r led from TurrbalTerror and fast starting Flouncy.  TurrbalTerror braked early, to leave Flouncy room and was nudged by Atomic Lambo enough to tap Flouncy who was trying to go round the outside.</p>
<p>It looked like being a hard fought battle between the Mclaren teammates until bobaj0r went off on the entry to turn 7, giving a clear lead to TurrbalTerror.  Krispy89 and Fredzfrog made brilliant starts through the first few turns but couldn't keep their cars planted on track after turn 4 of lap 1. </p>
<p>TurrbalTerror and Ghost pitted at the end of lap seven, giving the lead to Flouncy who led until lap 16, when the chasing pair of HolyGhost79 and TurrbalTerror caught, with TurrbalTerror effecting a pass through turns 2, 3, and 4, before Flouncy spun out of contention on the exit of turn 9.</p>
<p>From there, it a was a quiet race to the flag for TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost, with Flouncy finishing in a hard fought third.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Everyone was expecting it, an Atomic Lambo win, on this one of his more dominant tracks.  The event started well for Atomic Lambo, with pole position by a small margin over Flouncy. </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="12" />
<p> </p>
<p>Atomic Lambo held the usually fast starting Flouncy at bay with some aggressive defending through the turn 3, where arguably Flouncy had his wheels past the mid point of the Force India car. No doubt one for the stewards and the fans on internet forums around the world to argue over. Once Atomic Lambo was through there was little stand in his way, besides the concrete wall on the inside of the pit straight, which attract him, along with a number of other drivers throughout the race.<br /><br />After the round of scheduled stops the race had a new leader, HolyGhost79 who had pulled away to an impressive lead, followed by Flouncy, TurrbalTerror, and Atomic Lambo.  Atomic Lambo made his move when TurrbalTerror lost traction and ended facing perpendicular to the racing line, before a correcting - losing a few seconds.  <br /><br />Krispy89 had an impressive drive on his return to racing weekend, giving the more established drivers a hard time at moments before succumbing to his own inconsistency. Krispy89 is a driver to watch and with a little more consistency he will be a regular podium contender.  <br /><br />McLaren number two and recent returnee had a race he'll soon forget, with an unspiring qualifying and a drive backwards through the pack, his lack of track time evident.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.) How tremendous does it feel to be the only Formula 1 World Champion since Jack Brabham to have built your own car?</strong><br /> I'm kinda shocked to be honest that all it took was some wood, nails and glue.  How hard can it possibly be to build an F1 car?  HRT should give me a call.<br /> <br /> <strong>2.) Who is more inspirational - Ralf Schumacher, Nelson Piquet Jnr or David Coulthard?</strong><br /> Oh it's got to be Nelson Piquet Jnr.  He's shown us that you don't need a spine or balls to be in F1.<br /> <br /><strong> 3.) Describe the Zen technique you use to enter a state of elevated racing consciousness prior to a race.</strong><br /> Kimi passed on a tip to me once that prior to each race you should drop a huge shit.  Not only does it save weight but I've been told that Tibetan Monks cleanse the colon in order to reach new levels of zen and peace.<br /> <br /> <strong>4.) Would you rather be stuck on a desert island with Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosely or Flavio Briatore? All are drunk and horny.</strong><br /> I've been in a devils threesome with Bernie, and he's just a selfish lover.  At one stage he broke the cardinal rule and made eye contact with me and it's just been weird since then.  Max would want to act out some sort of fantasy 3rd Reich thing, so it's gotta be Flavio.  And with that silky smooth accent who wouldn't.<br /> <br /><strong> 5.) Should Fernando Alonso wear a beard?</strong><br /> I didn't know he was gay?<br /> <br /> <strong>7.) Can you explain Sebastian Vettel's oversized lips and unusual head-shape?</strong><br /> Have you ever seen Justin Beiber and Vettel in the same room?  Me neither.<br /> <br /><strong> 8.) What is your second favourite circuit and why?</strong><br /> Next to Montreal, I do love Monaco.  It rewards the brave and every time I drive it I get flash backs of Senna climbing the hill up to the Massenet corner.<br /> <br /> <strong>9.) What is the secret to Kimi's awesomeness? </strong><br /> The man can teach us so much not just about racing, but life itself.  I mean take a look at this wisdom.  I keep these quotes taped to my toilet door so I while I'm zenning, I can memorize his immortal words.<br /> <br /> "The Constructor’s Championship doesn’t really mean anything to me."<br /> "I’m not interested in what Jackie says. He hasn’t got anything to do with me."<br /> "Coulthard can say what he wants. I’m not interested in what he’s saying."<br /> "I don’t give a damn about what Trulli says."<br /> "Montoya’s comments doesn’t interest me."<br /> "Driving is the only thing I love about F1."<br /> "I’m not interested in what people think about me. I’m not Michael Schumacher."<br /> "Others can sit in the simulators if they want. I'm here to drive."<br /> "Well, in summer there's fishing and fucking. And in winter... the fishing is bad."<br /> <br /> The man is a god.<br /><br /></p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Valencia season 3: who will win?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the championship tight at the top, the European GP at Valencia is shaping up to be an important point in the championship.  HolyGhost79 has nearly a full race win and pole lead over second place Flouncy, but a poor result here could put him well within reach.  Valencia is a favourite of the current championship leader, so it'll be a tough race.</p>
<p>Here's last seasons qualifying results, to give us an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="51" />
<p> </p>
<p>With a tightening field we dont' expect such a large spread this year, with it likely the top five drivers will be separated by less than a second. </p>
<p>Will McLaren's steering upgrade prove a boon? or will bobaj0r need a race to come to grips with the changed dynamics.  While on the topic of steering, this weekends Valencia GP should have given Flouncy enough time to optimise his new steering configuration.</p>
<p>Can Lambo take out another win? Will TurrbalTerror keep his recent consistency?  Can Krispy89 get hooked up with the front runners? </p>
<p>This is shaping up to be the biggest GP of the season so far. Be sure not to miss it!</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>British GP preview<br /><br />One of the iconic grand prix are upon us this weekend, with the race at the airport turned circuit, Silverstone in England for the British grand prix.  Silverstone is a high speed track with a number of challenging corners following the recent redesign.  Getting a car setup to handle both aspects is challenging and getting it right will likely reward the driver with a win or at least a podium position.  Last season saw some of the closest racing in years, as the top four circulated for a numnber of laps, within a few meters of one another before pitstops broke up the show.<br /><br /></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="52" />
<p><br />Silverstone detester, Atomic Lambo sat on pole position after slippery conditions saw a slightly unexpected grid, with TurrbalTerror in second place.</p>
<p>The race was one by Flouncy, after he drove skillfully through the field.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Race" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="52" />
<p> </p>
<p>Bookies for Season 3 would have Flouncy as odds on favourite for pole, with a Group Force India front row lockout. My prediction has bobai0r in third, and Atomic Lambo in fourth, with TurrbalTerror qualifying in fifth position.</p>
<p>This race should see the return of Mac Dude and potentially the first race for Hulkster.  It's going to be a cracker.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Valencia saw the arrival of a new talent, ET ROM au, in an impressive debut where he finished well up the order and kept his nose clean.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="13" />
<p> </p>
<p>After a dry qualifying Valencia saw the first wet race of the season and boy did it rain hard.  The first lap, with the pack bunched up, was reminiscent of Adelaide 1991 when the race was stopped at after 14 laps, and probably what it was like at Malaysia in 2009.  Visibility was near non existant as the pack slithered and slide around the track, with Flouncy pulling a 5+ second lead before half of the first lap was completed.  The pack came round to the bridge and saw Flouncy parked beside wall, probably putting his gumboots on.  From there, HolyGhost79 showed the pack the way as mistakes continued a plenty.</p>
<p>As the track dried as some were starting to think about pitting for intermediate or dry tyres, Atomic Lambo blinked first and pitted for Options.  A move that would see him capitalised on new found levels of grip, if only for a short period.  TurrbalTerror followed close behind on the same lap and pitted for intermediates, in a hope to replicate his Season 2 feats of cutting 3+ seconds a lap out of the leaders times, but it was not to be, as the inters proved worthless, with TurrbalTerror not able to replicate his full wet tyre pace of 1:45.9. </p>
<p>Atomic Lambo eventually lost his lead to Flouncy, after an inspired drive from the back of the back.  Clearly his gumboots kept his toes dry and provided the level of comfort other drivers only wished they had.</p>
<p>HolyGhost79 also pitted, but his crew fumbled his stop and put wet weather tyres back on and out he went, putting it into the wall at the first turn and forcing a re-pit, this time for dry primes.  It was enough for TurrbalTerror to get by into fourth, but not enough for  him to hold HolyGhost79 off, demonstrating why dry tryres are better than wet tyres when the sun is out.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Race" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="13" />
<p>Flouncy describes Valencia season 3 as his most rewarding drive ever, and with a come from last place on lap 1 to the lead, it's not hard to see why.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>It was clear from the off that Flouncy meant business at Silverstone.  His pole time of 1:31.085 stands as the fastest lap we've yet seen of this circuit at a race meet and was significantly faster than second placed HolyGhost79. This gird had a larger spread that the previous few races.</p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="14" />
<p> </p>
<p>Race day threw up another doozie, with heavy rain yet again.  Flouncy made a clean start as the pack slipped and slid through the first few corners, battling over minor positions.  The end of lap 1 was exciting, as HolyGhost79, bobaj0r, and TurrbalTerror all jockeyed for 2nd position coming out of the last corner.  bobaj0r got squeezed by HolyGhost79 into TurrbalTerror as HolyGhost79 past TurrbalTerror, but both went off on turn 1 of lap 2 and bobaj0r was back in second place before his own mistakes cost him a higher finish.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerror lost more and more ground over the first five laps as he drove clean off the track on more corners than not, losing out a whooping gap of 45 seconds to bobaj0r in fourth place.  It was a gap that was to stay consistent until the end of the race.</p>
<p>Flouncy had his own misfortune when his steering dettached from the cockpit and he was lucky to salvage fourth place in front of a luckless Atomic Lambo who was forced to pull off track to take answer his phone.  Maybe Force India will invest in a handsfree before the next event. Although driving whilst talking on the phone is not against FIA regulations.</p>
<p>The misfortunes of two of the leading front runners was the fortunes of the fans, as it enabled the chasing pack to close up in points, but HolyGhost79 to extend his points lead ever so marginally.  Fortunately over the whole weekend, Flouncy and HolyGhost both had finished in P1 and P4, with only qualifying points difference the decider, and that swung in second place Flouncy's direction.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>There's no denying that Hockenhiemring is another Atomic Lambo circuit when it comes to raw pace.  He easily sits on top the Super Grid at this track and does well here.  That said, it's not all going to swing Atomic Lambo's way.  Qualifying record holder and current clear championship leader is HolyGhost79, though we hear he may not be able to make this weekends race.</p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="53" />
<p> </p>
<p>Last year's grid was definitely close at the top, with only 0.1s separating the top three qualifiers, in probably the smallest field ever.  </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Race" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="53" />
<p> </p>
<p>It seems whether or not HolyGhost79 can make this event will determine who the winner will be.  Although this season should be a little more competitive, with bobaj0r and TurrbalTerror both likely competitors up near the front and the addition of ET Rom au and Maverick, along with possibly Mac Dude and Hulkster.</p>
<p>Another exciting race on a track many people enjoy will be the likely result.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Hungary looks to be another interesting race with Flouncy taking every pole position at this circuit, and Atomic Lambo following close behind in second place. </p>
<p><strong> Season 1</strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="35" />
<p> </p>
<p><strong> Season 2</strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="54" />
<p> </p>
<p>With Flouncy and Atomic Lambo occupying the top two positions in both seasons, and Eradicator84 on sabatical, the front row of the grid seems to be a foregone conclusion.  The only spanner in the works may be HolyGhost79, but his times are consistent across both seasons, so it's likely he'll only put in a 1:24 something come qualifying day. </p>
<p>What will hapen come race day?  Well, the statistics can once again cast some light on the probability of the result for Season 3</p>
<p><strong>Season 1</strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Race" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="35" />
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Season 2</strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Race" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="54" />
<p> </p>
<p> So it seems likely Atomic Lambo will bring it home in third position and Flouncy should win, ignoring the Season 1 anomoly which was probably the result of an electronics gremlin exiting the pits.</p>
<p>Again, Season 3 should see a deeper field, with possibly 9-10 drivers competiting, which could mix up the results and help bring the season closer together.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Following recent schedule schanges there has been allegations that F1 rights holder Lambo is favouring certain teams, leaving other teams and drivers at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Recently the atomic f1 championship has fallen into political turmoil of sorts which saw the withdrawal of 4th placed championship conteder, TurrbalTerror, in protest.  When we interviewed TurrbalTerror he cited FIA bias toward Group Team Lotus and it's drivers, and bending over backwards to accomodate their desires. </p>
<p>This schedule change had a tangible effect on new entrant ET Rom AU who had made special provisions to ensure attendance of the event at the scheduled time.  It was later revealed that ET Rom AU could not make the rescheduled time and the F1 rights holder was unwilling to accept a delayed start, resulting in the smallest grids of the championship season to date.</p>
<p>Thus sparked the withdrawal of TurrbalTerror, who found it hard to continue in the championship when it was clear to him special favours were being handed out, and after he missed 4 races of season 2 in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Bobaj0rs comments later pulled the scab off the wound and the pus ran free, so to speak, and what seemed like a bottled up tornado of rage was unleased in the FIA / FOTA meeting, where certain teams and drivers expressed a desire for either clarification of the rules, definition of the rules, or even a establishment of a second teir category, leaving the teir 1 drivers: Ghost, Lambo, and Flouncy to battle it out for outright honours.</p>
<p>As is ever the case the smaller teams are complaining of a lack of track time and hoarding of skill, leading to a widening division between teir 1 and teir 2. </p>
<p>Perhaps the rise of Team ROM will help heal the divide, as their two drivers climb up from teir 2 well into teir 1.  While this is probably a tall order during the current season, big things are expected of Team ROM in Season 4, when a raft of new rules and regulations are expected to be introduced.</p>
<p>One of the results of the FIA / FOTA meeting is that any agrievances were allowed to be aired and it was eventually decided that the best way forward is to leave things as they are.  It seems perhaps Lambo is continue where is predecessor, Bernie Eccelestone left off.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>With the battle between Flouncy and HolyGhost79 so close, results in Korea were always going to be hard fought and extremely important to both drivers.   HolyGhost79 grabbed his gauntlet and in true monty python style figuratively slapped Flouncy across the face with it as he threw it down at his opponents feet, with an impressive pole time, 0.2s clear of second placed, and returning driver, TurrbalTerror. </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="21" />
<p> </p>
<p>As with most races, turn one lap one provided probably the most dangerous corner of the race, with the a near affray as 9 ambitions  were funnelled through one small point in space and time.  While a modicum of respectability was afforded to all at the pointy end, the more ambitious brought the battle to them with TurrbalTerror and Flouncy both forced offline through contact.  Fortunately this gave Ghost time to recover and keep his lead.  ET Rom au then shot one up the port side of the leading pack as they entered turn 2, giving 10 second penalties to both Flouncy and TurrbalTerror. </p>
<p>Once the madness of the first few turns had passed, the pack settled down into a familiar order and by the end of lap one, Ghost and Flouncy were out front doing what it is they do best.  While the strategic skirmish up front played out, the battle for best of the race was raging, with divebombing, spins, slides and tears aplenty.  Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror duked it out for 3rd spot, trading blows lap by lap, with TurrbalTerror slowing down to keep the battle alive, finally to away in the last few laps to ensure a podium.  Much to his dismay he’d forgot about the 10 second penalty handed out for his part in the first corner goings on and it was enough to bump him back to fourth and wonder about what could have been.</p>
<p>Much the surprise of even himself, BreakerMorant crossed the finish line in a career best fifth place, earning his HRT team some well needed cash for next season.  The last of the finishes was debutant CruiserComet, who at one point was as high as fourth position on lap 1. </p>
<p>With two races remaining, HolyGhost79 is back in the lead of the championship.</p>

              <teaser><![CDATA[The title leaders swap positions at the top of the table as Brazil moves title decider to final round.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>Now the race is over one thing is clear, the championship battle is not.  Brazil shouldn’t have been surprising to anyone.  With HolyGhost79 dominating the previous race, history would have it that Brazil was Flouncy’s turn to dominate.  History, as it usually is, proved correct.  Flouncy tore up the Brazilian circuit colloquially known as the ‘Interlagos kart track’ in a record 1:09.985, putting pole position beyond the reach of his fellow drivers.  HolyGhost79 didn’t disappoint either, snatching 2nd position in the final stages of qualifying.  The front two rows of the grid were completed by the usual protagonists, Atomic Lambo and TurrbalTerror, making the most of his 10 laps of the Brazilian circuit in the last 2 seasons count.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="22" />
<p> </p>
<p>Thankfully Brazil did not see a repeat of the first turn of Korea, with the entire pack getting away cleanly.  The top four blasted down the back straight for the first time, braking heavily for turn three on cold tyres.  MaverickROM wanted to make the most of his start and used TurrbalTerrors gearbox as his braking aid as he shot into fourth place.  TurrbalTerror recovered unfazed and in dead last and 10th place, in the one of the fullest fields ever to grace the competition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the two contenders shot off into the distance, TurrbalTerror began his climb back through the pack and had claimed 9 by two turns later and was in 8th in another corner.  7th and 6th were dispatched on the same corners on lap two and scything through the pack was on in earnest and by the end of lap 4 he was in 5th place. </p>
<p>HolyGhost79 and Flouncy continued to trade sectors as they each attemped to assert supremacy over the other.  On lap 7 roxa3sora3 moved over onto the racing line to let TurrbalTerror by, which resulted, naturally, in a collision, as TurrbalTerror followed him onto the line.  The erractic Brisbanite continued on with only minor front wing damage; nothing a tweak to the front wing settings couldn’t fix.  Soon he was up in 3rd position, after passing MaverickROM and Atomic Lambo, the later having a short break in the infield at the bottom of the hill leading up the pit straight.  Turrball’s stint in 3rd was limited to only a couple of laps, as he misjudged just how far out into the track one of the barriers extend on the run up the hill toward the pits, and broke his front wing off entirely.  Fortunately it was a only a short distance to the pits. </p>
<p>With no hope of catching the leading duo, or that of Atomic Lambo, the oft erratic McLaren driver started, what ET Rom AU described as “playing” with the slower drivers, waiting for them to pass, only to repass them a number of corners later, then repeating.  While it’s not a new practice for TurrbalTerror, it’s most probably a practice that doesn’t sit well with race officials but none-the-less is hard to police. </p>
<p>When the flag dropped, it was the two that kept their noses clean, as they have most the season, that crossed the line in the places that mattered most.  This time with Flouncy in the lead and HolyGhost79 trailing.  What we’ve now got is a very exciting prospect.  The championship will be decided at the last race. </p>
<p>HolyGhost79 must bring his A game to walk away with the crown.  That much is certain.</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Back in the dawn of the atomic f1 championship, we were blessed with one of the most skillful pilots to grace the track, Eradicator84.  Using an Xbox controller, he managed to not only compete, but to shame his fellow competitors who were using more advanced steering devices (wheels), clinching podiums and the occasional victory in the process.</p>
<p>While Season 1 started very strongly, we saw a fading Eradicator84 in season 2, as he all to often fell back into the middle of the pack, the best of the rest.  He still had fight left in him though and run of podiums at the end of the season ensure he wouldn't leave the sport in disgrace.</p>
<p>Officially on sabatical from Season 3, it's hoped Eradicator84 makes a return to fulltime racing in Season 4 and comes back as strong as ever.  His return will do nothing but increase the strength of the field and give aspiring front runners a glimmer of hope that the seemingly impossible can be achieved in inferior equipment.</p>

It doesn’t matter if you’re the next hot thing or a multiple world champion, everyone starts the season on zero points and maximum potential.  19 races across the globe and months later, there can by only one champion]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/5226/trophies_285x400.jpg"  width="285"  height="400" alt="trophies.jpg" style="float: right;"/></p>
<p>Championships are built on the aspirations of many.  It doesn’t matter if you’re the next hot thing or a multiple world champion, everyone starts the season on zero points and maximum potential.  19 races across the globe and months later, there can by only one champion.  Victory is the reward of the brave, the cunning, and the most importantly the fast.  In a sport where fractions of a second makes the differences between winner and also-ran, split second decisions at seemingly random times are often the differentiator.</p>
<p>Before Season 3 was underway we had the 12 strong entrants: Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, HolyGhost79, TurrbalTerror, bobaj0r, Fredzfrog, OriginalBollum, Hulkster, CrusierComet, BreakerMorant, Krispy89, roxas3sora3.  Not all of those saw the opening race, and some never made the grid, other joined the competition later on, while others left early.  From race one in Bahrain it was clear the order would not change significantly.  The fast group remained, thinned slightly by the lack of Eradicator84 and the non-starting bobaj0r.  Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, HolyGhost79, and TurrbalTerror all stake a claim for ultimate victory in Season 3. </p>
<p>Tensions rose early on as intentions, punctuated by aggressive actions were made clear by the various would-be champions.  After the first four races it was looking that HolyGhost79 was clear favourite to win.  His race consistency was proving hard to beat and the championship was looking beyond reach of all but Flouncy by the midway point.  Flouncy’s four wins on the trot and strong qualifying performance gave him maximum points and before we knew it he was leading the title race.  Had HolyGhost79 cracked under pressure?  Had the normally ice cold driver started to fall apart when it mattered?  HolyGhost79 proved his naysayers wrong in Korea with an emphatic pole and race win, but Flouncy retaliated with the same in Brazil.  The field of would-be’s whittled down to one ‘already is’ and another ‘should be’. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi is a track neither contender has won on or achieved pole on before.  It is the stomping ground of third place Atomic Lambo.   This season both contenders come from Group Force India and do not have the luxury of using their teammate as a foil to their opposition. </p>
<p>What does this mean?  It means that Abu Dhabi <strong>must</strong> be about pure speed and talent.  The finishing position in this race will determine whether we have a dual world champion or a new world champion.  It’s also a race about the non-contenders.  Where will their allegiances lie?  Have deals already been made for favours?  Will title runners #3 and #4 finish the race in positions #1 and #2.</p>
<p>They say victory favours the brave. They say victory favours the fortunate.  They say victory favours the strong.</p>
<p>Well,  i say victory will only be for the driver that has all three.  This is not kids play.  This is the finale of season 3 of the Atomic f1 championship.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[There can be only one.  That one was Flouncy, but not before HolyGhost79 put in a stunning drive to keep his hopes alive.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>In the end it came down to a little over 2 seconds.  That’s the size of the gap between champion Flouncy and contender HolyGhost79.  The fairytail didn’t go as planned though. Flouncy had eyes on a pole to flag win and he looked good at the midway point, with a lap of 1:40.259.  TurrbalTerror managed a 1:40.5, to provisionally fill second place.  A lap later TurrbalTerror crossed the line in 1:40.129, only to better it on the next lap with a 1:39.744.  Atomic Lambo and HolyGhost79 were still to mount their assaults on pole but ultimately they would fall short, some 2.2183s and 2.620s respectively.  The rest of the field was spread evenly back to BreakerMorant at the tail end, crossing the line in 1:48.176.    107% was 1:46.726.</p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO type="Qualifying" macroAlias="F1InlineRace" raceid="23" />
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the pack got away the Group Force India in second place made it’s usual stunning getaway and had it’s nose ahead into turn 1.  Flouncy backed off, not wanting to lose the championship on the first corner, while TurrbalTerror kept it wide not wanting to get in the way of a potentially epic battle.  Atomic Lambo saw his gap and took it, through into second place at turn two, leaving TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost79 in to start the battle for the bottom podium position.</p>
<p>A few laps in and HolyGhost79 went past TurrbalTerror after he ran it wide on Turn 17 and stayed off track while HolyGhost79 went past.  Turrbal clawed back the 3 second gap by the next lap and the dicing between himself, HolyGhost79 and Atomic Lambo was back on, continuing past the first round of pit stops which all three took at the end of lap 7.  The on track battle helped Flouncy to extend his lead to comfortable 15 seconds by the middle of the race and it seemed the race was done and dusted.</p>
<p>HolyGhost79 was not going to give up that easily and through the second half of the race he reduced the gap down to a visible 2.6s.  Ultimately the race long battle he fought with his car beat him, as he spun on the final lap, preventing any possible final confrontation and putting the championship winner beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Well done to Flouncy on another spectacular title win.  What do the other drivers have to do to overcome this phenom.</p>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Atomic F1's double champion dishes the dirt on what makes him tick, what's in store for his teammate, and how we can go about beating him in Season 4]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>First of all, congratulations on wrapping up your second title under such strong opposition. Many didn't rate you a chance at the halfway point. Lets get straight into it shall we</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> What was the turning point in your season and what made you believe you could catch your teammate in equal machinery?</strong></p>
<p><em>As the season ran through its first half Ghost was steadily building a lead, but I thought things would somehow magically balance out – my goal was to be in contention near the end, along with at least one other front runner, preferably more, but I underestimated just how strong out of the gate Ghost was as the season started, and how consistent he’d be. </em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p><em>Heading into Valencia - that was the start of my more motivated try-harder campaign to get some points balance back. I realised that track was the make or break point in the season for me and I really needed to close the gap.</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p><em>I was pretty pumped up about winning that one – because, of the following three races (Silverstone, Germany and Hungary) I reckoned I’d be able to win Silverstone and Hungary, and that’d bring things back to relative equilibrium.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I got Valencia, but bloody Ghost then went on to win all three of the following rounds. That fightback of his, plus the thrill I was still on from pushing and really wanting it at Valencia, and getting that one, gave me a real kick in the pants. So after Ghosty had shot ahead with his hat trick I looked at the numbers and realised I’d pretty much have to win six of the next (and last) seven races.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The only one I was relatively sure of was Suzuka. The rest was a real battle and really really exciting as it progressed. It made the racing so much more involving, tense, a bit emotional and as the wins came in I couldn’t relax. I felt just like a real racer, and that was neat. </em><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>You've had a number of brilliant victories over the course of your championship. Which was the most rewarding? </strong><br /><br /><em>Totally Valencia. It had real ‘story’ and drama. After my off at the start I really had to dig deeper than ever before and drive fast, and perfectly. Discovered I quite liked that super-concentration, so was able to take that Zen to the rest of the season. I love that circuit but it’s one where everyone is pretty evenly matched. I liked that win also because I showed myself I could take it to Ghost in the rain.</em><br /><br /><br /><strong>The season has been long and stressful, how do you plan to celebrate your victory?</strong></p>
<p><em>Think I might dive into a big arse RPG, or some Civ 5, maybe some Total War – the opposite of racing, some nice peaceful turn-based gaming where a few beers actually improve my skills :} And some mountainbiking. And less ice cream.</em></p>
<p><br /><br /><strong>You are now the most successful driver in the history of atomic f1, and nearly the oldest.  How will you keep motivated for another campaign.</strong><br /><br />The season and how it plays out will take care of that. I actually wanted Ghost to win the championship this time – I was only really chasing the points battle cos that part of it was fun, the whole coming from behind thing. But of course the win feels pretty good. Commiserations to Ghost, he’s an amazing driver, a top bloke and a real gent on the track.<br /><br /><em>So next time I’ll just enjoy the ebb and flow of the racing. Hopefully there’ll be a bigger grid, and we’re all so bloody good at this now some really close racing is on the cards, and that’s great.</em><br /><br /><em>Also, hopefully F1 2011 will have improved handling, so it’s a nice refresher for everyone to re-learn the cars, and see how we all stack up against each other with that.</em><br /><br /><br /><strong>It is rumored next season will see the mandatory pairing of a "fast" and "slow" driver. This will see the championship winning Group Force India team broken up.  Who do you think you teammate HolyGhost79 should team with? </strong><br /><em>Fredz. It’s only natural. They have a magnetic attraction for each other’s cars on the track.</em><br /><br /><br />Finally, there are a number of new drivers on the grid this season, and with expansion plans in place, the Atomic F1 Championship will likely see new blood injected as the new regulations and car specifications come into play. <br /><br /><strong>What advice have you got for new drivers wanting to hone their skills and one day challenging for the top spot?</strong><br /><br /><em>Just do a practice session before the race. I do one 40% GP against AI on the Sunday and that’s enough, along with as many practice laps as needed to feel good with the setup. Time Trial teaches bad habits, avoid it.</em><br /><br /><em>Learn how and where to overtake on each track, and be able to take a corner various ways to give you the flexibility to overtake – and vice versa – know where you’re vulnerable. </em><br /><br /><em>Drive to survive. Don’t out-pace yourself. Know which corners in a race are the danger ones where you’re more likely to come off, and get those right. If need be tailor your car setup around making sure just those corners can be done with better odds of doing them cleanly.</em><br /><br /><em>Just learn the car. Once you’re fully Zenned with how the car handles, you can tackle any track and it becomes about carving fractions of seconds out as you improve, and that’s always a real joy.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There you have it.  Dual atomic F1 champion Flouncy give us some insight into what makes him tick and how we might one day wrest that title from him.  Thanks Flouncy and have an enjoyable off-season.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Final agreement on the season 4 points system has nearly been reached and should be ready soon, says new commercial rights holder Flouncy]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/6044/math_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="math.jpg" style="float: right;"/>After taking over the commercial rights to the atomic f1 championsihp from previous owner Lambo, a number of refinements have been made to the running of atomic f1.  Not least is the system by which points are awarded to drivers.</p>
<p>Under the existing system points are awarded for both qualifying and race. The top 5 qualifiers being awarded 5 points down to 1 for finishing 1st through 5th. Race points are awarded from from 1st down to 10th, with 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1 being the points awarded. </p>
<p>One of the issues raised in recent FOTA/Flouncy discussions was the points gap between the top 4 and the rest of the pack.  While the top 4 generally did compete in more races than the the rest of the field, the awarding of points for qualifying has been cited as one of the reasons why the gap between the top 4 and the rest was so high. </p>
<p>Historically the reward of pole position was the best starting position, and the best opportunity to win the race especially on tracks where overtaking is possible.  However, in recent years overtaking has been generally much easier to do and the intrisic value of pole position diminished.  The awarding of points provided new motivation for drivers to perform on Saturday instead of parking it in the garage through qaulifying. </p>
<p>However, now the performance between the field is once again contracting, the rewarding of points for qualifying has again been raised.  New commercial rights holder, Flouncy's, who together with the FIA, after consdiering from FOTA has the final say in what the new structure will be.  Flouncy's latest draft has the points system returning to the more traditional, without qualifying points, and a 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1 structure from 1st down through to 10th.</p>
<p>However, with the deadline date for the points system not until the start of October there is still plenty of time for FOTA to lodge an appeal.  Also, the FIA doesn't release it's new, F1 2011 operating framework until September 23, where some of the decisions being made today may be overruled.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>We've wrapped the most recent season of the ongoing F1 2010 (soon to be F1 2011) full-season championship. Now it's time for a bit of fun. All are welcome to join in these one-off races! Many of our season regulars will be there, and we have room on the grid for those who have the game but for whatever reason weren't able to compete in the championship.<br /><br />What's 'special' about these, then? 100% race distance!  Anything else? <strong>No restrictions on driver aids!</strong> <br /><br />Race details:</p>
<ul>
<li>7pm start on the scheduled Sunday nights. Be online a few minutes before 7 and you'll be invited.</li>
<li>All cars are set to equal performance - so it doesn't matter what car you end up with.</li>
<li>We start with a Qualifying session, then to race.</li>
<li>Damage is on. Tire wear and fuel use is on. Racing rules are on.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br />The calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday 23rd Jul - Melbourne</li>
<li>Sunday 7th Aug - Suzuka</li>
<li>Sunday 21st August - TBA (let's discuss!)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /><strong>The grid:</strong><br />F1 2010 supports 12 players. The number 'regulars' from the F1 2010 championship vary, some races only half a dozen have turned up, while I think the record is about 10. So! There's a few slots available, and not all the regulars will make all events so post now if you're keen!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Your car:</strong><br />We can't guarantee which car you'll get at this stage, the regulars will likely be racing their preferred cars as follows (but remember all cars are equal so it doesn't actually matter - and not all will be at all races so the car you get is a bit of a lucky dip):<br /><br />Lotus - Ghost<br />McLaren - kikz<br />Red Bull - Flouncy<br />Renault - Lambo<br />Mercedes - Maverick<br />Ferarri - ET<br />Williams - Nobody813<br />HRT - Mac Dude<br />Red Bull - Fredzfrog<br />Sauber - bobaj0r<br /><br /><span>Please indicate if you're 100% gonna be racing, and which events (that goes for everyone!).</span></p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>The atomicf1 league ran it's first out of season 100% race distance event at the weekend just gone, and the circuit was Albert Park in Melbourne; everyones home track.  The initial qualifying session saw a few different tactics employed by the top runners, as this more open format gave them a chance to experiment and have some fun.  HolyGhost79 set the outright pace, qualifying on pole with a 1:27s lap.  TurrbalTerror slotted into second place after qualifying on primes, with a 1:29.  The next two places were occupied by AI cars, Kubica and Alonso, before ET ROM took 5th spot.  Surprisingly Flouncy sat out the session, perhaps favouring a fun drive through the pack from the rear.</p>
<p>Qualifying was mooted by the late arrival of roxas3sora3 who had been held up at a sponsor event.  The grid reformed, randomly drawing their grid position from a hat, karting style.  This was enough to give BreakerMorant his first front row slot of the year.</p>
<p><img src="~/media/14716/breakerfrontrow_400x188.jpg"  width="400"  height="188" alt="breakerfrontrow.PNG"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pack got away, but certainly not cleanly, as TurrbalTerror shot one up the inside and collected roxas3sora3 off the start, allowing ET ROM to pull a consistent lead for the first few laps.</p>
<p>A spin TurrbalTerror back to 5th behind Flouncy and HolyGhost79 in 3rd and 4th, and the chase was on for the race victory.  By lap 15 the wet track had dried and it was time for dry tyres.  Some of the pack switched to option tyres, some went out on primes, while others got their radio signals mixed and their crews put them back on wets.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerror remained true to form and smash his nose into a category red break and continued on like that for the next 15 to 20 laps, trying to stay ahead of Flouncy and in particular HolyGhost79, with whom he had an epic battle until again losing it.  This time HolyGhost79 waited up, again keeping the battle going.  TurrbalTerror picked up on the game and not wanting to not win on merit baulked at the overtake, before nailing the throttle, driving past, and spearing into the wall at the next turn.  Flouncy took his opportunity and went through into third.  TurrbalTerror recovered and made it back in front of HolyGhost79 and behind Flouncy, with some perhaps questionable driving, before pitting.</p>
<p>When the 2nd round of stops was done, TurrbalTerror was back in third spot and pulling away from Flouncy, when Flouncy and Ghost decided it was time to engage hyperdrive and reel the erratic Mclaren drive back in.  At that point it was on like donkey kong and the mercedes powered car increased his lead out to 11s only to have it brought back to 8s in traffic, before pulling out a gap again.  Another spin put him back within 3s of Flouncy and it was enough for the Group Force Lotus drive to pounce two laps from the end, when some side by side action through the fastest section of the track saw TurrbalTerror go spearing off.  From there, Flouncy led HolyGhost79 home into 3rd and 4th spots.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley the cameras were never on the rest of the field long enough to get a good picture of what was going on. Probably a lot crashing and spins.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>The second out of season race was run last night, to fantastic success, at the Honda owned Suzuka circuit in Japan.  We had 10 starters, made up of some first timers, st8tsmann and notjedi, as well as some occasional oldies such as bushipoo, and recent newbies like CruiserComet, as well as stalwarts Flouncy, HolyGhost79, and TurrbalTerror, and more. </p>
<p>On the books, Suzuka was going to be a Flouncy track.  He dominated the qualifying times here in season 3 and there was strong case the run would continue in this one off 'exhibition' race.  His form was true and he set pole with a 1:33.2.  Perhaps a surprise to Flouncy, but not TurrbalTerror, was TurrbalTerrors second place with a 1:33.5.  He hasn't race at Suzuka since season 1 and while happy with the time, he said it was far from the perfect lap and down on the 1:32.7's he was doing in practice.  2nd place in sesaon qualifier HolyGhost79 slotted into third with a 1:35, consistent with his in season form.  Both TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost79 were handed grid penalties for blocking, dropping then down to 7th and 10th respectively, 5 places for TurrbalTerror and 15 for HolyGhost79.  Both were unjustified.  TurrbalTerror received his after slowing down off line to let following cars by, and HolyGhost79 sufferred steering problems on track.  That drop looked like it would all but hand Flouncy a victory his was likely to take anyway.</p>
<p>Off the line, TurrbalTerror got away well, accelarating hard behind Maverick_ROM in 6th place and st8tsmann in 5th.  TurrbalTerror kept inside on turn one and moved to 6th position, gaining another into turn 2.  ET_ROM shut the door on st8tsmann as he attempted to pass for 2nd, sending the renault car flying off to the left of track and possibly breaking the space-time continum in the process.  St8tsmann seemed to circulate in a universe of his own after that, never seeing another car again, although random ghosts of st8tsmann appeared throughout the race.</p>
<p>With st9tsmann dispatched, ET_ROM set about keeping a fast clearing out Flouncy in-check.  It wasn't going to happen, as Flouncy increased his gap through the essess and TurrbalTerror had now come from 7th to be latched to the back of his gearbox, eventually taking him Dunlop Curve.</p>
<p>As he did in the rain in Valencia, Flouncy showed the world it's possible for double champions to make mistakes and was coming back on track at the hairpin on lap 1 as TurrbalTerror passed him for the lead, 7th to 1st in half a lap, beating Senna's effort in Donnington 1993.</p>
<p>TurrbalTerrors lead wasn't to last long, as Flouncy pushed him hard, and while he wasn't flustered he made an unsual mistake (unsual for this circuit at this event) and ran wide on the fast run into Degner.  With a halfspin, it was enough for Flouncy to just get through on the outside!  For one of two times in 53 laps, TurrbalTerror spun on the exit of Hairpin two corners later and suddenly Flouncy had an 8 second lead. </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoid="7-7O5q1mRXQ" aspectratio="widescreen" videoheight="" macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videowidth="600" allowfullscreen="1" />
<p> </p>
<p>As HolyGhost79 made his way up from 10th to 3rd, and in the process apparently breaking the timing devices, the gap between Flouncy and TurrbalTerror remained fairly static, between 6 and 8 seconds.  Over the next 15 laps TurrbalTerror made a few more errors and gap fluctuated it's way to 23 seconds before the leading pair came to lap Maverick_ROM.  Maverick_ROM drove a clean race but as he approached, TurrbalTerror started making mistakes, perhaps second guessing where the Ferrari was going to place itself to allow the McLaren to get by.  He past Maverick_ROM but a spin at the Hairpin allowed the ROManian to unlap himself and running very wide at Spoon incresaed the gap. Finally missing the chicane at Casino Triangle followed by diving into the pits for new primes, meant the next timed lap he was 1:03s down on the leader. </p>
<p>As the midfield battled with a playful HolyGhost79, and echos of st8tsmann would flash through the universe, the gap between first and second rained steady at 63 seconds.  Suddenly TurrbalTerror slowed down to 1st gear.  Did he have a problem?  It turned out he did.  His problem was boredom and acceptance that on this day in the Japanese sun he again didn't have the consistence pace to keep up with Flouncy. </p>
<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO videoheight="" aspectratio="widescreen" macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videoid="i7KmnBSQWPk" videourl="" videowidth="600" allowfullscreen="1" />
<p> </p>
<p>What seemed like hours past as the McLaren idled around the track and eventually HolyGhost79 and Maverick_ROM came round to battle for second place.  On fresh option tyres, and the car setup to carry an extra 3 seconds a lap through the Esses, it wasn't going to be a battle but at least it would be fun.  TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost accelarated and braked at random intervals occasionally being punted or getting punted as they toyed with the emotions of the man in red. </p>
<p>It was Maverick_ROM who had the last laugh though, as on the final lap TurrbalTerror was pushed wide and off track by BreakerMorant; the old man not recognising the silver streak on the righthand side.  Maverick_ROM slotted in to second place only 2 laps down on Flouncy.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>After the resounding success of the 100% distance out of season events, the race distance for season 4 has been extended from 40% to 100%.  To accomodate this increased distance only 1 race per race weekend will be held. The same 15 minute qualifying session will be used.</p>
<p>Having 1 race per weekend will give drivers and teams the chance to focus on one track during practice each week.  It will also give the opportunity to midfield drivers to make up places if they make mistakes or get punted early on in the race.</p>
<p>It will make the season longer, but for those not able to compete in a full season, they can participate as motivation allows. </p>]]></content>

<p>Season 3 saw the closest grid in the history of the atomic f1 competition, so this race is sure to be competitive, as everyone strives to win the last race using F1 2010. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Since that race we've got a number of new-comers with plenty of performance, including the ROManians, and CruiserComet, st8tsmann and more.  All will be keen to have crack at the established drivers.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/11060/timetrial_397x296.jpg"  width="397"  height="296" alt="timetrial.PNG" style="float: right;"/>McLaren and Team Lotus turned out for pre-season testing on Monday night, 3rd October, at the Melbourne circuit.  Both teams ran strongly and consistently, turning in mid 1:23's laps in race simulations, and lower in private qualifying runs. </p>
<p>McLaren spokesman Rob Gray cited the test session as a major success after evaluating DRS system improvements, which enabled the DRS to stay open for longer than a split second.  Previously, a fault in the DRS switch ment the drag reducing opening would close immediately after it opened.  Once this fault was found and repaired, the McLaren car gained an instant 1.2s in lap time, enabling TurrbalTerror to complete qualifying simuations runs that put him 0.5s up on the second place sitter.</p>
<p>Lotus are also reporting a successul testing session, with improvments in handling resulting in performance upgrades.</p>
<p>Both teams are expected to complete further testing prior to this weekends sesaon opener at Albert Park.</p>]]></content>

<p> </p>
<p>There are a few new drivers this season, notjedi  and st8tsman, as well as one driver returning from sabatical, Eradicator84.  Season 4 will also be the first full season for MaverickROM, ET ROM, and bobaj0r.</p>
<p>This season the FIA has introduced a "Team Skill Level" cap which aims to balance the driver ability of all of the teams and provide a more even playing field in the Constructors battle, making it something of keen interest to all involved.</p>
<p>Season 4 is also the first season the Atomic F1 competition will be run under the F1 2011 rules, including DRS, KERS, and the safety car, something that will no doubt feature heavily in most races and will surely result in some unepxected results and cunning strategy.</p>
<p>Preseason testing at Suzuka has shown the cars to be considerably faster over a single lap than their F1 2010 counterparts and has also introduced a new serious competitor for podiums and wins, ET ROM.  There are now 6 teams out of the 7 registered that are currently capable of wining a race.  As notjedi has yet to put in any track time, Red Bull may also be a contended for wins, making Season 4 easily the most competitive season to date.</p>
<p>The rights holders will also be producing an unprecedented amount of video footage, with four cars now carrying onboard cameras in each race, giving an incockpit view of the action up and down the field.</p>
<p> As ever, Flouncy is expected to top the timesheets from the opening session, though historically Albert Park has been race that has not always gone his way.</p>
<p>While last seasons results aren't particular accurate in light of the rule changes, they may give an indication of outright pace:</p>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/3106/little_flounce_398x260.jpg"  width="398"  height="260" alt="Little Flounce" style="float: right;"/>Ferrari's Flouncy has taken the first race of the season with a controlled drive at Melbourne's Albert Park. Despite starting from the second row of the grid the Ferrari looked to have it all under control as he cruised to his third consecutive victory and his seventh win in eight starts since round thirteen of the Italian Grand Prix in Monza during season three. While a comfortable win in the end, it wasn't all to plan with the Ferrari dropping to 8th after the first corner after a tangle with the Mercedes of ET-ROM and Renault of Lambo. However a good recovery and consistent pace saw the Ferrari leapfrog the Renault at the first set of pit stops, and errors from ET-ROM saw him pass for the lead shortly after. The Ferrari never looking troubled after that.</p>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Who will win in the heat and humidity of Malaysia?  Will it be a wet dry race?  And really, can anybody stop Flouncy?]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/19698/kl-sepang-circuit.jpg" width="300" height="240" alt="kl-sepang-circuit.jpg" style="float: right;"/>Racing in the humitdity and heat of Malaysia is always interesting.  If it's not the sweltering heat, making the body lose litres of fluid, it's the thundering storms making the track a dangerous river with swirling with 19000 brake horse power.</p>
<p>Over the past three seasons Malaysia has seen one man dominant.  Flouncy has held pole and won the race at every Malaysian GP thus far.  Do we expect things to change for season 4?  Unlikely, although I'm sure the hot new talent of ET Rom is going to be trying his hardest to break the stranglehold the double champion has on this circuit.</p>
<p>Maybe with the rules shake up for Season 4 and F12011 spec cars, a new pole sitter will emerge, although it's unlikely that the race result will differ.</p>
<p>What can we expect from the Malaysian GP this season?  Well, action for starters.  Sepang has 15 corners and a few of them contain apexs that are unsighted on entry as well as tightening radiuses, meaning those corners favour the brave and the skilled, or even both.</p>
<p>Some corners to watch out for on race day are the obvious turns 1 and 2 on the initial lap.  The tight nature of turn 1 followed by the switchback for turn 2 is expected to catch a few drivers out and it's anticipated there will be at least 2 spinners at that corner.  The best way to survive is to start further up the grid.  That doens't gaurantee safety though, as a rookie looking to gain places up the inside of turn 1 will likely carry too much speed and take a few scalps with him.</p>
<p>The hairpin turn 9 might also provide some action, as in the past it has proved an overtaking spot for the brave. </p>
<p>Probably the most difficult corner is turn 14, the tightening corner prior to the long back straight.  Exit speed is crucial here if you want to put a move on at turn 15.</p>
<p>My money is on Flouncy for pole. He's just too fast at this circuit.  The podium will be filled by Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, and ET Rom, in that order.  Dark horses will be TurrbalTerror and bobaj0r.  If both can keep their cars pointed forward and remain basically indicent free, McLaren should take constructos honours here.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/6044/math_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="math.jpg" style="float: right;"/>The F1 circus moves to Sepang Malaysia for round two of the the Atomic F1 championship. A favourite amongst the drivers it's long straights are broken up with a mixture of low, medium and high speed corners requiring extreme concentration and providing a real challenge to the drivers. With one round in the bag already it's early days in the championship race, however it's never too early to dissect and ponder. For the fans the past week has been about a number of pre-season questions, some of which have been answered, some not and others only when we are well into the season will we know for sure. But until the first qualifying session there's still plenty of time for Jonathan Leggard to check his crystal ball and place a bet on his thoughts for the Malaysian Grand Prix.<br /><br /><strong>In form:</strong><br />If you put money on Flouncy to win at Albert Park you probably didn't did get a very big return. So heavily backed was the Ferrari driver to take the race out with both fans and bookies that there is already talk the championship maybe over. Close to unstoppable in Melbourne and Sepang being a track that he finds more favourite-able, it's hard to put your money elsewhere. <br /><br /><strong>Out of form:</strong><br />Critics agree that the most disappointing drive of last weeks Melbourne Grand Prix was that from Lotus' Ghost. His form last season was near to perfect and he was close to unstoppable in the early flyaway races of season 3. The move to the pirelli, DRS and KERS could be contributing factors, however he'll want to turn around his season fast.<br /><br /><strong>One to watch:</strong><br />ET-Rom picked up from where he left off from pre-season testing with a stunning maiden pole at Albert Park. It's no mistake that he's considered this seasons hot talent, however a few mistakes in the race cost him second place and maybe even the race win. Still in the learning process, but it would seem that taking the next step is only a matter of time.<br /><br /><strong>Talking points:</strong><br />The question on everyones lips is can Ferrari's Flouncy be stopped. While some say it's too early to tell, not everyone has been able to fully adapt to the change in rules, especially with higher degradation of the perelli tires. What ever the reason some go as far to predict the most dull season so far if he remains unchallenged.<br /><br /><strong>Fast facts:</strong><br />- This will be the 4th Malaysian GP in Atomic F1 history. Flouncy has won every Malaysian GP so far.<br />- Qualifying record: Flouncy 1:34.972<br /><br /><strong>The circuit:</strong><br />Designed by "the architect of F1", Hermann Tilke, Sepang is considered one of the most technical circuits on the calendar and is a firm favourite with the drivers. The combination of long, high-speed, straights and tight corner complexes were designed with overtaking in mind. <br /><br /><strong>Betting:</strong><br />There no question who the fans favour to take out his 4th Malaysian GP win, Flouncy will be looking to add his Australian GP trophy and all but cement his championship favourite status. Flouncy 2/1, Lambo 8/1, Ghost now slips to 15/1. Worth putting an each way bet on ET-Rom, 12/1.<br /><br /><strong>Leggard prediction:</strong><br />You can't pass up Flouncy. 3 wins from 3 starts at this track, he might be troubled if it rains, but it's almost certain he'll put a 4th win on his CV.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Team Ferrari has received a major setback to its training and development program, with the recent release of Might and Magic: Heroes IV.<br /><br />The Ferrari #1 driver, Flouncy de la Flounce, has been spending many precious hours which were planned for on-track testing in the new game, which has been described as "magically addictive" and "so pretty".<br /><br />Ferraro team supremo Stefano Domenicali insists this is no cause for concern, and is simply a planned strategic part of Flouncy's stress management program.<br /><br />When asked when de la Flounce will resume on-track development duties, Domenicali explained that his star driver was currently "off with the fairies" and is expected to make an appearance after "just one more turn."</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/5232/williams-car_400x272.jpg"  width="400"  height="272" alt="williams-car.jpg" style="float: right;"/>It's a dry sunny Friday afternoon here at Sepang. I'm on the grass here at the entrance of the pit lane to speak with a couple of team Williams' most important leaders. Sam Michael, Williams Technical Chief and Sir Frank Williams, Williams Team Principal.<br /><br />I met with Sam first to talk about how both Williams drivers, roxa3sora3 and Eradicator84 put in some good testing hours and came out of it with a nice surprise.</p>
<p><br /><em>"Based on our practice session runs we know for a fact that both drivers will beat last years fastest qualifying lap time." </em>said Sam, <em>"And we're not talking by a few tenths either. Based on our on-track data and simulations both drivers will easily surpass that time by several seconds each. So we're looking for a solid race from both drivers to bring maximum points in for the team on Sunday".</em><br /><br />When I asked about the notorious wet weather situation that often occurs at Sepang Sam replied, <em>"We're not too worried about a deluge this year, all forecasts indicate good weather on the day, but as you know that can change at a moments notice. If there's no rain on Saturday we might have to put the drivers into the simulators to get them comfortable with the new cars on a wet track. In fact..."</em> he said pointing to the sky behind me. I looked and there was some rather ominous looking clouds to the south east of the track. I turned around to finish our interview but Sam was already running back down the pit lane in a hurry, so I guess they've still got some work to do.<br /><br />I then met with Sir Frank Williams, who has made the effort to come to Sepang this year, to catch up and to clarify a few rumours floating around.<br /><br />"Sir Frank, I can call you that can't I?"<br /><em>"Please, call me Uncle Frank, we're all in the F1 family here"</em> he said smiling.</p>
<p>"Ok 'Uncle Frank' you don't often get out to tracks these days due to your health, what made you decide to come out for this race meeting?"<br /><em>"Well my wife Ginny has been nagging me to get out of the house so I thought I'd come and support the team in person this weekend. That and I wanted to test out my new wheel chair."</em></p>
<p>"So has any of this paraphernalia you've got here have anything to do with it too?"<br /><em>"Actually yes. My son Jonathan managed to get me this great team coloured automated cheering system attached to my chair. These pom poms are attached to these rotating articulated mechanical arms here on my wheel chair" he explained, pointing to the long spindly metal rods jutting up from either side of his wheel chair with blue and white pom poms attached to the end of them, "so when I'm watching from the side of the track I can push this big blue button here and the chair does all the cheering for me! How brilliant is that!?"</em></p>
<p>"That IS pretty neat!"<br /><em>"That's not the best bit though, see this container on the back on by wheel chair?"</em></p>
<p>"Yes"<br /><em>"This contains our experimental new KERS system"</em></p>
<p>"Really? It's quite small!"<br /><em>"Indeed, I plan to test it out on Sunday at the start of the race."</em></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /><em>"SHHHHH, keep it a secret. I'll be on the grid along with everyone else getting the cars ready for the race then when the cars go for their warm up lap I'll sneak back to the start of pit lane and wait for the safety car to pull up behind all the cars just before race start and drive over into his blind spot so he won't know I'm there. Then, when the race starts I'll flip this red switch here" pointing to an aircraft style switch with flip up protector on his right arm rest "and the KERS will activate and I'll race down the main straight to see how well our new system works! I might even deploy my cheering system at the same time to motivate our two drivers faster down the main straight at the start!"</em></p>
<p>"Umm, isn't that dangerous and against FIA rules?"<br /><em>"Shh! Keep your voice down!" he whispered loudly, looking around to see if anyone was watching us "Look with the amount of testing allowed by teams this year we have to be 'creative' in how, when and where we do our testing. I've spoken with Bernie and he loved the idea! He even bet I could beat the two HRTs to the first corner! But said I should keep it low key until the surprise moment."</em></p>
<p>"Oook then, well good luck with it"<br /><em>"Thanks it's going to be a hoot!"</em></p>
<p>"I wanted to ask you about the rumours of both your drivers being spotted in the McLaren and Red Bull garages today. What's that all about?"<br /><em>"Oh yeah there's a fancy new Xbox game the drivers all talking about, it's called '1102 1F' or something, you know how kids are these days, gotta play with the latest craze"</em></p>
<p>"So the fact that we saw both McLaren and Red Bull cars drive around the track today with their drivers wearing Soras and Marks helmets is just an accident or something?"<br /><em>"Yes... like I said... testing.. craze.. c-r-e-a-t-i-v-e"</em><br /><br />At this point his face was getting redder and redder and voice louder and louder, ranting on until he swivelled his chair around 180 degrees, flipped the red switch and in a burst of sound and grass debree was speeding back towards the Williams garage.</p>
<p><br />I'm not sure what what will happen now but the Williams drivers will have a good reason to get off to a quick start in Sundays race. Should be exciting!</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>By Andrew Benson<br /><br /><img src="~/media/1155/racestart_399x250.jpg"  width="399"  height="250" alt="racestart" style="float: right;"/>After a cracking season that has both surprised and disappointed spectators, the focus now moves towards Sepang. The new rules of a rookie driver with an established driver seemed to work wonders as we have seen close running throughout Albert Park. Most surprising was the result in which roxas3sora3 takes 4th place from a hard charging HolyGhost79 in 5th. "It was tough really. I thought he'll get by within a lap but I kept my head down and just do what I did best." a humble roxas3sora3 described in the pits afterwards. However, he is adamant that HolyGhost79 will one up coming Malaysia. "I don't like Malaysia as it's all about risks and something I can't learn that quickly."<br /><br />HolyGhost79 was disappointed in his result but was confident that he'll bounce back in Malaysia. "Malaysia is one of my favourite tracks. Given the layout and the possibility of rain, it's the place where I'll start my championship." And given the history of the circuit, it is a rough split of 50% rain and 50% dry.<br /><br />Martin Whitmarsh has been highly excited at Malaysia. "I'm confident we've got all the necessary means to win in Malaysia." TurrbalTerror is quietly confident at Malaysia too. "The car is running well ever since we arrived since this week. Bobaj0r has been helping out fine tune the issues in getting the car ready for race."<br /><br />Defending world champion Flouncy has been quiet over the up-down performance of his team. "At the moment, we're steadily improving the car and as well as BreakerMorant. He's still a junior but we should be able to get by." Some had questioned over the use of coded messages between Breaker and Flouncy during the Melbourne race compared to the straight messages the other teams have been using. One such compatriot, st8smn, has been at the receiving end of this given his DNF was the result of these messages. "All I heard was 'the train is entering the tunnel' and I lost it because I was laughing so much!"<br /><br />Renault team boss Eric Boullier had high praise for CruiserComet in his rookie run at Melbourne. "He was doing fine in comparison to all the rookies. He managed to be in 6th and holding off Eradicator, TurrbalTerror and as well as Fredzfrog. At the rate he's progressing, he should be a midfielder soon."<br /><br />Team Lotus was disappointed that the pre-season preparations hadn't come to fruition. "It's disappointing that we finished quite down on the order in Melbourne but due to incidents out of our hand, we're quite lucky to get this result." Mike Gascoyne was a lot more optimistic about Malaysia. "Malaysia is where we expect both team members to shine." Asked about Fredzfrog's driving style, the blunt reply was "What about it? Do you see Michael Schumacher being questioned over his driving style?"<br /><br />With that, all eyes turn to the qualifying tomorrow night.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/21138/chinese-flag_400x264.jpg"  width="400"  height="264" alt="chinese-flag.PNG" style="float: right;"/>The Atomic F1 circus arrives in the booming nation of China this weekend for round 4 of the championship.  The question on everyones lips this weekend is can Flouncy bounce back to form and mount a challenge to the re-invigorated bobaj0r.</p>
<p>Qualifying position at Shanghai will be paramount. With the a difficult off-camber changing radius turn 1/2, it's expected that, like all previous Chinese grand prix's the start will be havoc. With the increased grid size in Season 4, this problem will only be magnifed, as any off will mean having to wait for the entire field of 16 to go by, and mkaing catching the leaders even more difficult.</p>
<p>One driver who shouldn't find this a problem is the double world champion Flouncy, who holds the current lap record around this circuit, some 3 seconds faster than the next best time, held by one bobaj0r. </p>
<p>That's not to say Atomic Lambo should be discounted.  He has featured strongly here in the past, at a circuit he regards as one of the biggest technical challenges on the calendar.  HolyGhost79 is also another strong runner, although his perofrmance of late have been less than the same time in Season 3 and his attendance at this GP is not yet assured, after voicing his feeling anti-communism put him high on the terror watch list with the peoples republic.</p>
<p>Shanghai will be a new circuit for many of the new drivers, including the Mercdes teammates ET ROM and MaverickROM, the later of whom desparately needs to improve his form after a lackluster opening races.  The Chinese GP will also be the debut of Modz, driving for the Sauber team and his appearance will no doubht through a spanner in the works of some of the established drivers.</p>
<p>Tyre wear and engines in Shanghai will be critical, as that long back straight has already destroyed a few engines in practice.  A wise strategy may be to run a long 7th gear.</p>
<p>I expect a three way battle for victory between Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, and bobaj0r, with ET Rom, Eradicator, TurrbalTerror and HolyGhost79, if he appears, fighting out a close battle for fourth spot.</p>
<p>The third pack will likely be made up of MaverickROM, CruiserComet, and roxas3sora3, with the rest of the field including NIGHTKID2, who is looking to have a better start than in Malaysia, Modz, fredzfrog, notjedi, st8smn350, and the ever improving BreakerMorant, who has already notched up some runs on the board.</p>
<p>Time to get the chopsticks out and say hello to the East.  It's the Chinese GP race wekeend!</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Jonathan Leggard offers his unique insight into this weekends fourth Shanghai Atomic F1 GP.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Will there be a Shanghai surprise?</strong><br />We've had two races on two very different circuits in Formula One 2011 so far with two different winners. However going into round 3 of the Atomic F1 championship the leading driver hasn't won a race yet. Lambo leads the championship by 5 points despite not winning either round, but thanks two consistant 2nd place finishes. The good news for neutrals is that, thanks to the new regulations and Pirelli tyres, plenty of wheel-to-wheel action has ensured Sunday afternoons remain unmissable. But it's also true that 2010 was one of the best seasons in recent years because of a four-way competition for the top spot in the championship, and if we are to see a repeat this season, McLaren, Ferrari, Lotus and Renault need a return to the top step of the podium sooner rather than later. Will China deliver the first twist in the 2011 championship tale? <br /><br /><strong>In form:</strong><br />Such was bobaj0rs dominance at Sepang not even a spin could stop him from taking the chequered flag in record race time. Last year bobaj0r struggled with bad luck in the opening rounds but this season looks especially promising. If Ghost winning at China last season was the jolt the championship needed then, than Bobaj0r winning at China will send bolts of lightning through the field. His odds have improved imeserabily.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Out of form:</strong><br />It was his worst race to date and probably much of it through no fault of his own, but theres no deneying that after his win in Melbourne, Flouncy didn't look like the dominate self in Sepang. Qualified poorly due to reliability issues his race was compromised from the first corner taking a spin and then suffering from a puncture later on. Managed to recover to a respectable 7th however the Ferrari driver will see that as a disaster. Will probably bounce back however Flouncy has never won here at China. <br /><br /><strong>One to watch:</strong><br />If Ghost last season was the shot in the arm the championship needed, then bobaj0r is like a lighting strike. Didn't compete in Melbourne, but rocked up to the second round in Sepang and set the timesheets on fire. Looking just as dangerous at China bobaj0r has leaped into championship contention.<br /><br /><strong>Talking points:</strong><br />The Drag Reduction System - For years F1 observers have complained that there is not enough overtaking in the sport. But now that a system has boosted the chances of wheel-to-wheel racing it is labelled as fake, with critics saying that the FIA dictates where the drivers overtake. Although true, it can be argued that it only enhances the existing overtaking areas and one place dictated by the FIA is better than nothing at all. Perhaps the biggest concern should be the complexity of the system (it can only be used when a driver is within a second of the car in front at a certain point on the track, but not in the first two laps after the start or a safety car … and not at all in the wet). For the casual viewer it makes an already complex sport even harder to understand. <br /><br /><strong>Fast facts:</strong><br />- This will be the 4th Chinese GP in Atomic F1 history. S1 - Eradicator, S2/S3 Ghost<br />- Qualifying record: Flouncy 1:33.484<br />- The circuit plan is designed to look like the Chinese character 'Shang', which means high or above.<br /><br /><br /><strong>The circuit:</strong><br />The Shanghai International Circuit is another new-generation F1 track designed by the ubiquitous Hermann Tilke. Unlike some of his other creations, the track does have some in-built character, such as team offices built on stilts over water and the impressive bridges over the pit straight - all built at a cost of US$459 million. On track there is a mix of high speed corners, long straights and big stops, requiring medium to high downforce levels. Overtaking is possible and the most likely location is at turn 13 where the cars brake from 200mph to 45mph after a 0.7 mile straight. Another notable feature on the track includes the 270 degree turn one that requires the cars to hit two apices before being spat out in the opposite direction in turn two. <br /><br /><strong>Betting:</strong><br />After his explosive win in Sepang it's time to get on the bobaj0r freight train. Bobaj0r 3/1, Flouncy 5/1, Lambo 7/1, Ghost now slips to 20/1. Worth putting an each way bet on ET-Rom, 18/1.<br /><br /><strong>Leggard prediction:</strong><br />If bobaj0r repeats his exploits at Sepang, he'll not only be the next races favourite, but most probably the next championship favourite.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Mark Fogerty interviews roxas3sora3 and shares a rare insight into the up-and-coming talent.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>"Just some Japanese green tea thanks." That was how simple roxas3sora3 was towards the waitress as we sat down in the Williams motorhome. After said drink appeared, we got on with the business of talking to one of the rare Asian drivers in this competition. After what was a promising start, I had to figure out what was going wrong with the man that is the steady rock of Williams F1.<br /><br />"Melbourne was probably one of the most memorable tracks really so I wanted something special of it. Going 4th and holding off a fast charging Ghost would be the highlight of my life." And the lowlights?<br /><br />"Well, I suppose the last round (Malaysia). We had a fantastic qualifying and were quite set to capitalise with our run. Then everything had to go pear shape. Kids at the back with no experience, they had to go and screw everything up for the rest of us." This was coming from a man that had been quite soft spoken about the new drivers of the competition. He didn't seemed fazed that implications of his spin came from these drivers. With that, I decided to speak to him about what happened in China after such a great qualifying session.<br /><br />"It was interesting as everyone expected rain on one qualifying and we got it here in China." In torrential conditions, roxas3sora3 managed to post the pole lap before sliding down the field. "That was one surprise as I expected everyone to hit very low 1:40s. So to be on pole for a second was good to savour but it wasn't meant to be." After in which, he finished qualifying in 7th which gives him the best qualifying position in the wet. "I'm still learning how to be fast in the wet. As long as I'm improving, then it should be interesting."<br /><br />However, all that good work in qualifying was undone instantly at turn 3. "Turn 3 to 4 was probably where I lost the battle in the midfield. I was on the racing line when the Red Bull (presumably st8smn) came alongside and argued over that position. I kept my stance and only it was when he started to push me off the line that I had to back out. If I didn't, I would have ended up with a broken wing. That single instant was when I lost the midfield battle. And it was frustrating to see him go and then lose that position so easily (after a few turns, roxas3sora3 kept in sight of the two cars, Red Bull and Saber before both lost it) didn't make me feel that he's ready for F1. I think whoever it is, he's not a racer, he's just a menace." Harsh words from a man that advocates gentlemanly racing but given his frustration and as well as the results, it is easy to see.<br /><br />But, were there any positives from that race? "Positives for me showed that I can mix it up with the midfield and get close to the top tier. All I have to do is be consistent and pounce on any chance to be better. Simple as that." And this racer will be interesting to watch as his strategies and excellent thinking made him one of the drivers that could easily be a no.1 driver.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Following on from Shanghai, Istanbul Park is another one of the modern F1 tracks that have been designed by Hermann Tilke. Bobaj0r is favourite to take out his second race and stamp a claim on the championship at 3/1 odds.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who's in for a Turkish delight?</strong><br />After a week break following what was a breathless Chinese Grand Prix, the Atomic Formula One paddock finally gets on the European roads this weekend with a trip to Turkey. Lambo took his first race victory of the season winning in Shanghai, but with only 15 points seperating him from Flouncy and the Renault driver not able to make the grid in Istanbul, we will likely see a new championship leader after this weekend. With 3 races in and 3 different winners, will we see a new race winner crowned? Or will someone start to stamp their authority on this season?<br /><br /><strong>In Form</strong><br />Having secured his first win of the Season and so far not having finished worse than 2nd, the Renault of Lambo is riding a wave of confidence. However since he won't be starting this weekends race and is therefore out of the hunt for any points we turn our attention to bobaj0r. Since missing Melbourne he's fought back with a stunning win in Malaysia, and a second in China. Confidence is high for the McLaren driver and with no Lambo on the grid has to be considered the race favourite at this time.<br /><br /><strong>Out of Form</strong><br />Ghosts depressing start to the season continued at China ruing a bad tire strategy and suffering from a number of run ins on the track. Considering his capabilities and the start he had to season 3 many in the paddock hoped for big things this season. Turkey should be a happier hunting ground having stepped on the podium last season.<br /><br /><strong>One to watch</strong><br />It would be unfair to say Flouncy's 7th in Malaysia and 3rd in China are a sign of a slump in form, but it's clear the Ferrari driver isn't entirely happy. However he has won this race and will look to put things right. One to watch.<br /><br /><strong>Talking Points</strong><br />Turn 8 - While Hermann Tilke's tracks have not always been the subject of immense praise, it's pretty clear that the greatest corner he has designed is an original - the multi-apex turn 8. Taken at an average speed of over 160mph, Red Bull were famously able to take the corner flat out last year. Drivers experience up to 5G of lateral force through the turn, and expect to see plenty of cars snapping off line during practice and qualifying. <br /><br /><strong>Fast Facts</strong><br />- This will be the 4th Turkish Grand Prix, previous winners, S1 - Ghost, S2 - Flouncy, S3 - TurrbalTerror<br />- The pole sitter has never won the race.<br />- Qualifying record - 1:26.339 - bobaj0r<br />- There are 14 corners on the circuit, but one - turn 8 - accounts for 40% of the tyre wear per lap due to its long high-speed nature. The cars are at full throttle for 8.5 seconds, putting a huge load on the front right tyre as the drivers experience an average of 3.5 lateral G.<br /><br /><strong>Curcuit</strong><br />Following on from Shanghai, Istanbul Park is another one of the modern F1 tracks that have been designed by Hermann Tilke. While everybody talks about the high-speed turn 8, Tilke has made good use of the undulations which sees a total elevation change of nearly 46 metres. The track mainly consists of medium to high-speed corners, with potential overtaking chances down in to turn 1 and turn 9. The best opportunity, however, comes after the long uphill back straight (interrupted by a right kink nicknamed 'Faux Rouge') in to the heavy braking zone for turn 12. Good traction is required for the slow complex of corners at the end of the lap before returning on to the pit straight. <br /><br /><strong>Betting</strong><br />Bobaj0r is favourite to take out his second race and stamp a claim on the championship at 3/1 odds. Next is Flouncy at 6/1, Ghost 9/1, Modz is worth putting an each way bet at 14/1, with ET-ROM coming in at 16/1. TurrbalTerror has had good fortunate at this track but starts just inside ET at 12/1.<br /><br /><strong>Leggard Prediction</strong><br />This season has been a seesaw of favourites, but going on current form it's hard to go past bobaj0r to put another trophy in the cabinet. <br />It would be unfair to say Flouncy's 7th in Malaysia and 3rd in China are a sign of a slump in form, but it's clear the Ferrari driver isn't entirely happy. However he has won this race and will look to put things right. One to watch.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[McLaren downbeat on Turkish chances.  Team prays for safe return of bobaj0r from the war zone.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>McLaren Press Officer Rob Gray today expressed his concern over the McLaren teams chances of success at this weekends Turkish Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Current team points leader bobaj0r has been called up for military service on the Battlefield for the near future, with only a short release from his military duties to participate in the atomic f1 events.  Team development driver TurrbalTerror is uncharacteristically struggling to find a stable setup for the notoriously edgy mercedes powered car.</p>
<p>Despite bobajor given 3/1 odds for winning from bookmakers, after a successful run built on solid setup development by TurrbalTerror, McLaren does not rate the current #1 contender so highly for this weekends race.</p>
<p>Unless TurrbalTerror can find a setup that works in the next few days, it is unlikely the Turkish event will be one to remember: Unfortunate, considering the pair locked out the front row last year and TurrbalTerror led the field to take his and teams only win of the season.</p>
<p>McLaren as a team are hoping their Season 4 star driver makes it back in one piece for the race.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[The absence of two top runners this weekend leaves the championship wide open.  Here is what the championship table will most likley look like following this race.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/6044/math_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="math.jpg" style="float: right;"/>With runaway points leader Atomic Lambo missing this weekends Grand Prix, and third place bobaj0r also out, the points table is set for a shake-up.</p>
<p>Based on testing form, current race form and last years results, the most likely results from this weekends race sees the podium filled by TurrbalTerror, HolyGhost79, and Flouncy, all of whom are battling their own form slumps or problems of late.</p>
<p>If TurrbalTerror leads  home HolyGhost79, followed by Flouncy, in a repeat of last seasons results, the points table will look like</p>
<ol>
<li>Atomic Lambo - 61</li>
<li>Flouncy - 61</li>
<li>TurrbalTerror - 52</li>
<li>HolyGhost79 - 52</li>
<li>ET Rom - 47</li>
<li>bobaj0r - 43</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably the best result for Atomic Lambo and bobaj0r.  Nearly just as likely is a HolyGhost win with Flouncy coming home second, followed by TurrbalTerror in third.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flouncy - 64</li>
<li>Atomic Lambo - 61</li>
<li>HolyGhost79 - 68</li>
<li>ET Rom - 47</li>
<li>TurrbalTerror - 44</li>
<li>bobajor - 43</li>
</ol>
<p>Where we'll see the top of the championship ladder break into two groups of Flouncy, Atomic Lambo, and HolyGhost79, with ET rom heading up group 2 infront of TurrbalTerror and bobaj0r.</p>
<p>In the event Flouncy wins ahead of TurrbalTerror, and HolyGhost79 the championship would start to look like seasons of old much earlier than we'd all like.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flouncy - 71</li>
<li>Atomic Lambo - 61</li>
<li>HolyGhost79 - 49</li>
<li>ET Rom - 47</li>
<li>TurrbalTerror - 45</li>
<li>bobaj0r - 43</li>
</ol>
<p>There's also some good points on grab for drivers further down the grid, with a battle 5th plce to be fought out between Eradicator84 and roxas3sora3,</p>
<p>The race should also see McLaren take the lead in the constructors title.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>When Atomic F1 turned up at the gates of the Circuit de Catalunya last season the Lotus of Ghost had already taken out 3 of the first 5 races, and finished no lower than second.  This season it's a very different story, with 4 races down, and 3 different winners, the top 4 drivers are separated by only 19 points.  It would be a brave person who would place a bet on the end season champion, and with at least 4 drivers within a win of each other, it's anyone's bet on who will take the chequered flag in Spain.  The outcome of this race will tell us a lot about what we can expect from the rest of the season, both from a competition and entertainment point of view. <br /><br /><strong>On form:</strong><br />Bobaj0r has stamped his title ambitions with a measured drive in Istanbul and with his worst finish so far a 2nd at China. If it weren't for the missed race in Melbourne there's no doubt the lead would be more than just 7 points. Lambo will be hot on his tale to reel in the small lead after the Istanbul GP, but with momentum and confidence on Bobaj0r's side it's clear he will be the one to beat in Spain.<br /><br /><strong>Out of form:</strong><br />Not long ago we would have said a 2 race slump would be a rarity for Ferrari's Flouncy, but after a disappointing 4th at Istanbul many are asking is the magic that lead to a stunning comeback in Season 3 and a dominate season 2 over?  After winning in Melbourne, the Ferrari number one has had difficulty with consistency over the last three rounds.  Having said that, he's only 10 points adrift from first place and a bounce back seems inevitable.<br /><br /><strong>One to watch:</strong><br />After a shakey start Eradicator is finally starting to show signs of the pace he showed in season 1 and 2. Some questioned his return but a strong 2nd place in Istabul silenced those critics.  With 3 wins from 42 races now getting to that top step hasn't been easy, however with confidence comes form and he could be the dark horse in Spain.<br /><br /><strong>Talking points:</strong><br /><strong>Overtaking:</strong><br />Overtaking is a rare sight at the Circuit de Catalunya and the dull races in recent years are exactly what this year's regulations are designed to prevent. The tyres will spice things up and the news that Pirelli is bringing a harder compound means the difference in grip between the prime and option tyres, a key factor for overtaking, will be even greater. The DRS is unlikely to be as effective as it has been in recent races as the corner at the end of the activation zone - turn one - is the first part of a sweeping chicane rather than a heavy braking zone. <br /><br /><strong>Updates:</strong><br />The teams traditionally target large update packages for the Spanish Grand Prix and this year is no different. The engineers and drivers know every corner of the circuit inside out from the miles of testing they have completed there over the years and can therefore gauge the success of a new part pretty quickly. This year Lotus, Sauber, Williams and McLaren are just four of the teams that have talked up their Barcelona packages, while many others will also make changes to their cars in the pursuit of shaving off a bit more lap time. <br /><br /><strong>Fast facts:</strong><br />- This will be the 4th Spanish GP - Previous winners - S1 Kikz, S2 Lambo, S3 Ghost<br />- The race has only ever been won once from Pole.  S2 Lambo.<br />- Kikz won the opening S1 race from 5th on the grid.<br />- Qualifying Record: Flouncy 1:22.397, which is likely to be smashed this weekend.<br /><br /><strong>Real life Trivia:</strong><br />- The Circuit de Catalunya was first used in F1 in 1991, a race remembered for Nigel Mansell's bold overtaking manoeuvre into turn one on Ayrton Senna.<br />- Barcelona hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975 in Montjuich Park. It was a tight and dangerous track that was eventually dropped in 1975 when five spectators were killed after Rolf Stommelen crashed over the barriers<br />- The park was later extensively re-developed for the 1992 Olympic Games<br />- Fernando Alonso is Spain's only Formula One race winner<br />- The very first race to run under the title of the "Spanish Grand Prix" was held in 1913, although it was actually run to touring car regulations rather than the grand prix formula of the day <br /><br /><strong>Circuit</strong><br />There is a very good reason why the cars return to the Circuit de Catalunya year-after-year to test. Its sweeping corners are very dependent on downforce, while the long straight requires a low level of drag. Put simply, if you're quick here you can be quick almost anywhere. Unfortunately all those fast corners come at the cost of reducing the chances of overtaking. Turn one remains a favourite place to try a move, while the big stop into turn 10 can be a possibility if the leading car makes a mistake through the tricky turn nine. The cars are at full throttle for 60% of the lap, meaning it is not the hardest track on engines. Pirelli is bringing its hard and soft compounds this weekend to combat front-left tyre graining, which will likely result in three stop strategies if it is a dry race. <br /><br /><strong>Betting</strong><br />Bobaj0r is the clear favourite at 4/6 odds, but anybody looking for a decent return on their money will be more insterested in Lambo or Flouncy at 11/2 and 9/2.  Ghost is now starting to show longer odds at 18/1.  The dark hourse however is Eradicator who's strong result in Istanbul has shorten his odds to 12/1<br /><br /><strong>Leggard prediction:</strong><br />In his current form you can't put a wheel past bobaj0r to make it 3 wins from 5 races.  However with unpredictable weather you never know.   </p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>FIA Officials have handed down a one race suspension to NightKid2 as a result of incidents in this race and previous races, after a warning following events in Turkey. </p>
<p>ET Rom placed NightKid2 on report after contant in the first lap put him into a spin, and contact later in the race also spun him round.</p>
<p>FIA Official Ben Mansill released the following statement regarding the suspension:</p>
<blockquote><em>The number 1 priority for all of us when we race is not to cause our friends in other cars to come off, and have their race ruined by our actions.  Finishing position comes after that as a lower priority.  You're still a rookie. You have yet to learn on-track racecraft.</em><br /><br /><em>When you see us on track, and if the videos of us lot look like we're getting real close, that's because we've been racing together for years. We know the cars, the tracks - and each other's driving styles. We trust each other. We know how to pass, we understand the difference between contact that will just make a noise, and contact that will throw someone out.</em><br /><br /><em>You are not at that level yet.</em><br /><br /><em>But, your raw car speed is. That's good. It means you have plenty of scope to think about driving safely, as you drive. You have the car control needed to be able to handle heavy traffic, and exercise simple passes. But you still drive in the manner one would against AI.</em><br /><br /><em>I've seen you take great care to give other cars room, but I've also seen you make reckless moves that have pushed others off the track -- moves that we're never gonna happen cleanly, no matter who was at the wheel in those positions, and shouldn't have been attempted. Just one or two of those in a season can make a driver's bad reputation. You're doing it at least a couple of times a race.</em><br /><br /><em>Now, again, accusations are flying and you're the center of it again. Your explanations earlier on this page regarding incidents with ET Rom do not match the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iclqSVkpKV0&amp;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank">video evidence</a>.</em><br /><br /><em><strong>Over ambitious, too aggressive - and with a focus entirely on getting past the car in front whatever the cost. </strong></em><br /><br /><em>You're so close to being someone we look forward to racing with. But this keeps happening. And you're indignant and defensive when you should be humble and apologetic. </em><br /><br /><br /><em><strong>Take a one race break. </strong></em><br /><br /><br /><em>We'll see you week after next at Canada, where your driving will be watched closer than ever. </em><br /><br /><em>Races are long, they are strategic. They are not turn-by-turn dogfights. Know your place Tim. You are new and you need to earn our trust.</em></blockquote>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>The entertaining Spanish Grand Prix has shown that the 2011 rules are a recipe for exciting racing on any circuit on the calendar. The one unknown that remains appears to be the crown jewel event that is the Monaco Grand Prix. Overtaking is not going to be easy by any stretch, but the tyre degradation and undercut available to earlier stoppers mean we should see positions changing and another intriguing race unfolding around the streets of the principality.<br /><br />The drivers are all still chasing one man: bobaj0r. While the close race in Barcelona will have heightened hopes of another McLaren challenge, Ferrari and Renault will want to spoil the McLaren drivers party as he goes for a 3rd consecutive race win.<br /><br /><strong>In Form:</strong><br />bobaj0r's form doesn't look like dipping any time soon, and while in certain parts of Spain Lambo and Flouncy matched him for pace he was close to untouchable. A clean getaway and error free race he will be the one to beat going into Monaco.<br /><br /><strong>Out of Form:</strong><br />It's no doubt that last seasons early title favourite Ghost is looking like a driver that's run out of steam. He was the talk of the town this time in season 3 and looked to have it in the books, but since loosing the title at the penultimate race in Abu Dahbi some months ago the Lotus driver has not looked comfortable all season and has struggled with both qualifying and race pace that made him so dangerous last season.<br /><br /><strong>One to Watch:</strong><br />Love it or hate it Monaco is a special challenge that almost all drivers enjoy. It rewards the brave and punishes even the smallest mistake. Renaults Lambo especially likes the 3.3km circuit having record two victories from three starts with his worst being second in Season 2. Ferrari's Flouncy is no slouch around here either having taken the only other victory in Season 2. Both will be on the lookout to displace the dominate start of bobaj0r.<br /><br /><strong>Talking points:</strong><br />DRS - It's been a talking point at many races this year, but the drivers seemed pretty united on one front for Monaco: it's too dangerous and should be banned. The FIA doesn't agree, and Charlie Whiting has said that it would be wrong to outlaw an overtaking aid where it could be needed the most. There is talk that drivers may be prevented from using it in the tunnel, but anyone who misjudges a braking point having used it will be heading for the barriers, and probably for a moan at the governing body. <br /><br /><strong>Traffic:</strong><br />It's always been notoriously difficult to pass around Monaco, in qualifying drivers will struggle to find clear air for a lap around the tight circuit, and the upshot in the race could be a lot of squabbling back markers for the leaders to overtake.<br /><br /><strong>Saftey Car</strong><br />So far this season there has been no safety cars, however with the tight circuit and no run off area's it's highly likely we could see several.<br /><br /><strong>Fast facts:</strong><br />- This will be the 4th Monaco GP - Previous Winners - S1+S3 Lambo, S2 Flouncy<br />- Despite overtaking being difficult, the race has only been won once from pole - S3 Lambo<br /><br /><strong>Real life trivia:</strong><br />- Monaco is renowned for its safety car periods as almost any accident requires one. In 2010 alone there were four occasions that the safety car was called upon, and historically there is a 60% chance of a safety car period in each race.<br />- Olivier Panis secured his one and only grand prix victory in Monaco in 1996, and in doing so set the record for winning from the highest grid position having started the race 14th.<br />- Two drivers have ended up in the harbour as results of crashes at Monaco - Alberto Ascari in 1955 and Paul Hawkins in 1965.<br />- A loose manhole cover last year caused Rubens Barrichello to have a major crash on the climb up to Massanet, and saw the race continue under the safety car for a few laps while stewards decided if it was unsafe. In his anger Barrichello threw his steering wheel out of the car and it was runover by Karun Chandhok's HRT.<br /> <br /><strong>Circuit:</strong><br />Monaco is worlds apart from the last track in Barcelona, and is the circuit where driver performance has the greatest influence. The tight and twisting slow speed corners require good traction and mechanical grip, while the length of the circuit - just 2 miles - means there are few straights of any note, with 180mph the top speed reached exiting the tunnel. The slowest corner on the circuit is the Loews hairpin, which is taken at just 30mph, and the quickest is the first chicane section of the swimming pool at 130mph. Being a street circuit the track surface is not overly abrasive, but cars need to be able to ride the bumps and undulations well. Overtaking is possible on the run out of the tunnel down in to the turn 10 chicane. <br /><br /><strong>Betting:</strong><br />Bobaj0rs odds seem to get shorter by the day, and he's favourite once again at 3/1. Flouncy and Lambo are reasonably priced at 5/1, especially taking in to account Lambos win last season. TurrbalTerror is a good outside bet at 18/1.<br /><br /><strong>Leggard Prediction:</strong><br />Bobaj0r may have stood at the podium in Spain but it's well known that Monaco is the hunting ground of Renault's Lambo. 2 wins from 3 starts at this venue he's well equipped to put pressure on the current championship leader so Leggard keeps it fresh by backing the Renault driver to pick-up 25 points.</p>]]></content>

Could we be seeing the start of another rivalry in Bobaj0r and Lambo who came to blows on the opening corner of Monaco? ]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The challenge of Canada</strong><br />Once again the Formula One paddock descends on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Canada to contest round 7 of the Atomic Formula One Championship. While all eyes turn to the 4.36km circuit for the 4th running of this race, all tongues are still waging from the extraordinary events of the Monaco Grand Prix. Every season we see intense rivalry between the top drivers. In season one and two it was Flouncy and Lambo, season three Flouncy and Ghost. Could we be seeing the start of another rivalry in Bobaj0r and Lambo who came to blows on the opening corner of Monaco? Time will tell but there's no doubt McLaren will be out for revenge and Renault will be desperate to claw back a lead after not scoring in both Monaco and Istanbul now. The scene is set for an explosive and exciting Canadian Grand Prix.<br /><br /><strong>In Form</strong><br />Once again bobaj0r needs a mention, despite the result in Monaco is still showing worrying pace for his competitors. Goes into Canada still with a healthy 14 point lead over the Ferrari of Flouncy. A special mention however should go to Ghost who despite starting last on the grid in the last race had a stunning win.<br /><br /><strong>Out of Form</strong><br />Renault will be desperate to get their championship charge back on track and right the wrongs of Monaco. Slipping in both the constructors and drivers championship this will be considered a make or break round now. <br /><br /><strong>One to watch</strong><br />Like a light bulb being switched on the Lotus of ghost has catapulted up the rankings after his unlikely win in Monaco. Perhaps this result is just the motivation needed to kick-start his season and with the Lotus driver being the defending race winner from Season 3 it could be a very close battle up the grid. One to watch.<br /><br /><strong>Talking points</strong><br /><em>DRS</em> - Having highlighted its importance at many races this year, once again the DRS is going to be a focal point in Canada. For the first time there will be two DRS zones; one on the Droit du Casino and the second on the start/finish straight after the chicane. There's only one detection point, so the idea is to give the following car a better chance to overtake if they can't get past at the first zone. It's likened to Melbourne, where a car closed on the run down to turn one, but couldn't pass, and then would have been helped by having the system available again on the run down to turn three. Only the car that is behind at the detection point can use it, so if a pass occurs before the chicane, the other driver can't use the DRS to fight back in the second zone. <br /><br /><em>Soft tyres</em> - The tyres are a talking point yet again, as the soft and super-soft compounds will be available as in Monaco. The race in Canada last year saw high levels of degredation, leading to such an exciting race that it was actually the catalyst for Pirelli being given the brief to produce rapidly-wearing tyres to make races more entertaining. That occurred on last year's much harder Bridgestone rubber, so what is going to be the result on this season's tyres is anyone's guess. <br /><br /><strong>Fast Facts</strong><br />- This will be the fourth Canadian Grand Prix - Previous winners S1, S2 - Lambo, S3 - Ghost<br />- Lambo has never not been on pole here with 3 poles from 3 starts.<br />- Lowest grid position this race has been won from is 3rd.<br />- The qualifying record is 1:14.227 set by Lambo in S3. Sure to be smashed.<br /><br /><strong>Real Life Facts</strong><br />- Canada is another circuit that is renowned for its safety car periods due to the close proximity of the walls around the circuit. In 2007 when Lewis Hamilton took his maiden grand prix victory he had to negotiate four separate safety car periods.<br />- The circuit used to be called the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame after the island it is built on, but was renamed in 1982 following Gilles Villeneuve's death at Zolder that year.<br />- The wall on the outside of the final chicane is known as the 'Wall of Champions' after former world champions Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve all retired after crashing in to it during the 1999 race.<br />- In 1982, pole sitter Didier Pironi stalled on the line, and although most of the grid managed to avoid him, Riccardo Paletti was unsighted having started from the back of the grid and crashed heavily in to the rear of the Ferrari. Paletti died from his injuries later in hospital. <br /><br /><strong>Circuit</strong><br />Canada is a high-speed, low downforce track where cars run special aero specifications. The circuit's long straights make a good top speed a necessity, while it is also a tough track on brakes. There are seven braking zones in total, of which six are considered to be 'heavy' and four of those require the driver to brake from over 295kph. Turn ten is the heaviest braking zone as cars decelerate from 295kph to 60kph in just 140m. As a result brake wear is always a factor, with teams sacrificing about 0.2s per lap in performance by running larger brake ducts to help cooling. Being a part-time circuit the track surface is not overly abrasive, but the cars need to be able to ride the kerbs well. The main overtaking opportunities occur in to turn one, turn eight and in to the final chicane. <br /><br /><strong>Betting</strong><br />bobaj0r is the bookies favourite still despite not having a great record here at 5/1 odds. Ghost is the most improved with his win here last season at 8/1 with Lambo not far behind at 9/1. Flouncy is a dark horse here despite not winning here either and is worth a look at 10/1.<br /><br /><strong>Leggard Prediction</strong><br />It looks like the championship is hotting up and top runners are starting to make their claims. I'm going to tip Ferrari's Flouncy to take his first win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/18935/spring.jpg" width="342" height="190" alt="spring.jpg" style="float: right;"/>Since the start of season 4 spring settings have had a mandated maximum of 8, even though it's possible to run them at 11.  While there had been no way to police this FIA mandated limit, a gentlemans agreement was in place.</p>
<p>With ECU updates on November 23rd that will address this problem, and others, the restriction is no longer required.  This means that there will no longer be any suspicion of a team gaining an unfair advantage by running undetecably illegable springs.  What is unclear is how these ECU changes will impact on overall spring dynamics and the hanlding of the cars at large.  It's not infeasible that car handling may change in such a way as to dramatically effect the status quo of the season 4 title race.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>F1 2011 was released with a 11/11 spring bug, as <a href="/{localLink:1662}" title="Setup Spotlight: Springs">documented in previously by Mclaren</a>.  This definitely showed a massive drop of in performance as springs got increasingly more soft.  Every 2 units of springs resulted in approximately 2 seconds off the lap time.  In reality, more grip, up to a limit, should be offered by softer springs. As a result atomicf1, mandated that springs no greater than 8 on either front or rear could be used. </p>
<p>Patch 2 of F1 2011 released today contained a fix for the 11/11 spring bug.</p>
<p>Mclaren have just completed a comprehensive test at <a href="/{localLink:1219}" title="Catalunya">Catalunya</a>, cataloging the various spring settings and their impact on lap time.  The car setup used is the <a href="/{localLink:1780}" title="Dry Qualifying">Dry Qualifying</a> setup for this circuit, with the only adjustments being made to spring settings.</p>
<p>The following settings were used.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/1</li>
<li>6/3</li>
<li>6/11</li>
<li>8/8</li>
<li>11/11</li>
</ul>
<p>Mclaren found no major diffences in lap times. Certainly not the differences that were found during their test earlier in the season.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fastest setup was 6/11 springs, which makes sense as softer front settings would decrease understeer, of which <a href="/{localLink:1266}" title="TurrbalTerror">TurrbalTerror</a>'s driving style produces in large quantities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><sub>Optimal lap is the sum of the three best sector times</sub></p>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Valencia is a semi-street circuit around the industrial area of an insdustrial Spanish city.  A high downforce circuit with a few straights thrown in for good measure.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>Valencia is like Monaco without the glamour and the history, or the challenge.  Considered one of the most boring circuits on the calendar, last seasons race was action packed, as the grid lined up on a very very wet circuit.</p>
<p>Season 4 Valencia marks the first race of the new specification cars, with 8/8 spring limits lifted but car handling subtley altered.  Who will best come to terms with the new regulations will be shown. Perhaps a new challenger will emerge.</p>
<p><strong>bobaj0r<br /></strong>Previously not particular fast at Valencia, with a 3rd and a 4th place.  After a stunning season thus far he's not expected to slow down and should start from the front row of the grid and finish on the podium.  Based on this seasons run, the most likely driver to win<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Flouncy<br /></strong>Previous pole sitter and Valencia afficionda, Flouncy will be out to close the gap to bobaj0r. After disappointing lack of pace at the Canadian grand prix, he's in with a good chance for the race win and based on previous results here, the most likely to start from pole.</p>
<p><strong>Atomic Lambo<br /></strong>The current aggregate Valencia winner, Atomic Lambo will likely start on the front row of the grid and battle bobaj0r for the race victory.  If bobaj0r doens't start from pole, Atomic Lambo will be favourite to win the race<strong>.  </strong>He's not finished less than 2nd this year.  <strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>HolyGhost79<br /></strong>Lately in a form slump that saw him put on his worst performance of his career, the season 3 runner up will be trying to re-capture his winning ways but is unlikely to challenge the top three drivers.  If he can get away clean, and qualifying well, he'll probably run home a solid 4th place.  His objective for this weekend is probably just to prevent TurrbalTerror closing in on him in the points standings.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>TurrbalTerror<br /></strong>Consistently the back of the front, TurrbalTerrors goals are to finish ahead of Eradicator84 and reduce the points gap to HolyGhost79<strong>.  </strong>Excluding his 10 place grid penalty in Melbourne, following steering failure, he has the 2nd best qualifying average of the grid, at 2.33.  It's statistically likely the McLarens will sit 1 and 2 on the grid, and on this street circuit, where passing may prove difficult, TurrbalTerror, as in Canada, might again prove to be a big stumbling block for Flouncy and Atomic Lambo if they want a shot at victory this weekend.  <strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>ET_Rom_au<br /></strong>ET Rom is out in the wilderness of sorts in the last couple of races, and although reporting initial problems with the ver 2.0 specifications for season 4, these changes provide him with an opportunity to improve his position and claw back some points on TurrbalTerror, only 4 points in front in the driver standings.  4th place will be his likely best result.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eradicator84<br /></strong>Always a high runner, Eradicator84 has previously done very well at Valencia and will surely be looking to stamp his unique style of driving on the track this weekend.  Likely qualifying mid pack, he'll surely surge up through field and be pushing for 4th or 3rd by quarter distance.  Another strong contender for that 4th place position.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>roxas3sora3<br /></strong>With an average result of 7.5 at Valencia, this race is sora's change to improve as a possible 5th or 6th place finish is beckoning. If he can stay out of the barriers and out of contact from other drivers, in the hard fought mid-pack, he should finish well.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>NightKid2<br /></strong>Likely making his return after a 1 race ban and missing 1 race of his own decision, Valencia gives NightKid2 an opportunity to show he can drive cleanly and still carry the pace he's becoming renowned for.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>CruiserComet<br /></strong>After a frustrating disconnection in Canada, CrusierComet is looking forward to an interruption free race in Valencia and will hopefully be battling it out with roxas3sora3 for 6th position.  Perhaps he struggles the with a flow of information from the other side of the Lotus garage<strong>.<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>BreakerMorant<br /></strong>If he's in attendance this weekend, Breaker will be looking to make the recently released footage of his career look silly, by showing his no mobile chicane.  The most life-experienced driver on the grid will be out to show CruiserComent who's boss.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Modz85<br /></strong>Another dark horse, Modz85, if he can stay connected with the race track, may be in for a blinder. He could even finish first amongst those that have not yet won a race.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>st8smn350<br /></strong>Should have a good race here.  His connection issues seem to be sorted out, or at least improved the time being and hopefully he'll show some of the pace he had during pre-season testing.  If so, the front runners will be concerned and we could have our drive of the race.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fredzfrog<br /></strong>Season 4 backmaker, FredzFrog is hoping to recapture his speed from last year and if so will give at least a few of the drivers above him a lesson in driving.</p>
<h3>Constructors</h3>
<p>There's little to talk about here, other than Mclaren's complete domination of the field.  In what is now a very unbalanced team compared to the others, the Mclaren juggernaut will not be stopped this season.  The only glimmer of hope for the other teams is that the FIA will likely break the team apart at the end of the season as they strive for more parity between the teams.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Mclaren, Mercedes, and Williams complete Friday practice at Valencia]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>The Friday practice session at Valencia has ended after two 20% race simulations, including qualifying. </p>
<p>Run 1 was held in wet conditions for the qualifying session, with TurrbalTerror and Mclaren taking pole by over two seconds.  The practice was a dry affair though and TurrbalTerror pulled out a 6 second lead by halfway round the 2nd lap, where he promptly pulled over to sip his latte while the other drivers, Eradicator84, roxas3sora3 and ET_Rom made their way around the circuit.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO videourl="" videoid="WMNRpZpy5ms" aspectratio="" videoheight="" macroAlias="uTube.ClassicPlayer" videowidth="" allowfullscreen="0" />
<p>The session ended with TurrbalTerror winning the race with a race fastest lap 1.6s faster than Eradicator84, the third place finisher and 2nd fastest race lap.  All other drivers also lapping within 0.3s of Eradicator84, in a confidence boosting drive for roxas3sora3.</p>
<p>The second qualifying session was dry and allowed all drivers to turn the wick up. Again it was TurrbalTerror posting the fastest time, some 2.2s faster than 2nd fastest time of Eradicator84.  Again, Eradicator84, ET ROM au, and roxas3sora3 were seperated by less than 0.2s</p>
<p>The race session was also dry and this time TurrbalTerror had no coffee to stop and drink and drove 11 mistake free laps to take the flag 20seconds ahead of Eradicator84.  In a confidence booster for the race for Eradicator84, this time his fastest race lap was only 0.5s slower than the Mclarens fastest, although still 1.1s slower than the time the McLaren set in race 1.  roxas3sora3 also set a race best lap time 0.1s faster than ET rom au, but still 1.0s adrift of his teammate.</p>
<p>Sunday's race looks like be a competitive affair through the pack.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/26519/silverstone_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="silverstone.jpg" style="float: right;"/>This weekends race at Silverstone presents the first opportunity to provide a more level playing field for new competitors. The Silverstone circuit has been revised since 2010, with the pits and start finish line moved half way round the track, as well as a reprofiling of moving of some of the corners leading into the new pit lane.  While not a big difference it's may help new drivers finish higher up that previously. </p>
<p>Initial laps of the circuit have shown the 2011 performance gap comparative to 2010 is not as high here as at other circuits, noteably the last race in Valencia.  Running a default setup on primes yielded a lap time comparable with last years pole position, rather than the 4 seconds faster Mclaren were seeing on the default setup at Valencia.</p>]]></content>

It's proposed the last race will be held on December 18 and racing will recommence on January 8, if this is suitable for everyone.  If not, please proprose a new time on the <a href="http://forums.atomicmpc.com.au/index.php?showtopic=45163&amp;pid=934941&amp;st=2200&amp;#entry934941">forum</a> or in the comments.</p>
<p>As always, this doens't mean there can't be non-official events any any time, amongst the competitors and other interested parties.  Realistically, this is an ideal opportunity for people to get in some valuable practice ahead of the second half the season. </p>
<p>FIA has mandated that all team members must be allowed to spend time with their families, and the middle of this 19 race long season is a good time for this.</p>]]></content>

<p></p>
<p>Recently received from an anonymous source, spy footage of a secret Mclaren test at Silverstone reveal the constructors championship leaders are struggling with pace and balance as they work feverishly on preparations for this weekends British Grand Prix at Silverstone.</p>
<p>From the footage obtained Mclaren can clearly be seen spinning on a number of occassions as TurrbalTerror tries to hone in on a setup. </p>
<p>From the evidence on this footage, Mclaren have a long way to go and the other nearby teams look sure to snare a rare race win unless preparations take a drastic turn for the better for the Woking based team.</p></p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><b><img src="/media/26738/uk-flag-6.jpg" width="380" height="257" alt="uk-flag-6.jpg" style="float: left;"/>Stiff upper lip</b><br />Silverstone is the host for round 9 of the Atomic F1 championship as drivers and fans flock to the famous race track to see the cream of the crop of Atomic F1's elite take on the challenging circuit. An all new pit and paddock complex will provide a new challenge as drivers customise to the new layout. Who will triumph at the famous circuit? Atomic F1 pundit Jonnathen Leggard peers inside the crystal ball and tries to dissect who will step atop the podium at the British Grand Prix.<br /><br /><b>On Form</b><br />In what's becoming an almost dull section of this feature, McLaren's Bobaj0r still stands as the one to beat. Since shrugging off the incident at Monaco he's won at both the Canadian and European GP's and will be looking to join a very special club of drivers who have one 3 consecutive races. Now with a more comfortable lead the McLaren driver won't be looking to slack off with plenty of races to come and the second place finish of Ghost in last seasons championship a stark reminder that you can never relax. <br /><br /><b>Out Of Form</b><br />ET Rom's explosive pace at the Melbourne GP was hope that the famous silver arrow would play a role in this seasons championship. However some disappointing results and an equal worst 7th place in Valencia has left some fans scratching their heads. On the flip side race pace has been solid and for all counts the Mercedes has been the 'best of the rest' for most of the season. However you can't help but feel ET is knocking on the door of another podium sooner rather than later.<br /><br /><b>One to Watch</b><br />Ferrari's Flouncy hasn't had the best of seasons so far. Bad luck and some slight off form pace has seen him drop to 3rd just a few points off the Renault of Lambo in the championship standings. However Silverstone is a favourite track and the Ferrari driver has traditionally been very fast around here in the past. Some say that he's the most likely to challenge the McLaren's for the win on Sunday. Definitely one to watch.<br /><br /><b>Talking Points</b><br />Pirelli dabbled with the idea of bringing the medium compound tyre to Silverstone but ultimately settled with the original plan of bringing hard and soft. The Italian firm knows that its rubber is in for a tough weekend as it is tortured through the high-speed sections, but is confident its product is up to the challenge. The bigger question is whether some of the teams are up to the demands of the hard compound tyre. The only time this specific compound has been used in race conditions was at the Spanish Grand Prix.<br /><br /><b>The Future of Silverstone</b><br />Silverstone hosted the first Formula One Grand Prix in 1950 and has built itself on the reputation of being "The Home of Motorsport" ever since. It's a circuit worthy of the title and now it has the facilities to match thanks to the recent opening of the Wing. The brand new pit and paddock complex looks as though it will be on par with far-flung venues such as Shanghai and Korea, which is crucial with F1 searching for more and more cash-rich venues to hold races. There will undoubtedly be a few teething issues with the new facilities, but the sheer good will built up since the first impromptu race on the site in 1947 means there should be very few complaints. <br /><br /><b>Fast Facts</b><br />- This will be the 4th British Grand Prix, previous winners - S1 Ghost, S2 Flouncy, S3, GHost<br />- Qualifying Record - 1:31.085 Ghost - S3<br />- The race has never been won from pole position.<br /><br /><b>Real Fast Facts</b><br />- Keke Rosberg averaged 160.938mph in a Williams when he set pole position at the 1985 British GP, making Silverstone the world's fastest GP circuit at the time.<br />- British drivers have won their home grand prix 21 times, more than any other nation.<br />- The Maggots, Becketts, Chapel complex is one of the fastest corner sequences on the calendar and is entered at 185 mph, with drivers pulling 5G through Becketts.<br />- Jim Clark led John Surtees and Graham Hill in an all-British one-two-three at Silverstone in 1963.<br /><br /><b>Trivia</b><br />- The name Silverstone derives from the Old English for "wooded area".<br />- In the early years of the event spectators were not allowed in the circuit's infield area for fear they might damage the local farmer's crops.<br />- The circuit has seen many changes down the years. The last major alteration before last year's was in 1990 when Becketts was revised, a new section between Stowe and Club was added and a five-corner complex before Woodcote was built.<br />- Silverstone hosted the inaugural round of the Formula One world championship on May 13 1950. Giuseppe Farina won in an Alfa Romeo 158, with an average speed of 90.95mph<br /><br /><b>Circuit</b><br />Silverstone has long been a favourite among the drivers and the alterations to the circuit last year didn't change that. The high-speed corners were retained and even added to with the new nearly-flat-out Abbey Corner that features a sizable bump on entry. The extra 0.8 kilometres of track, added roughly 10 seconds in lap time but opened up some good viewing opportunities for spectators and a couple of overtaking opportunities at Village and Brooklands. This year Brooklands should see even more passing as it marks the end of the DRS zone down the long Wellington Straight. <br /><br /><b>Betting</b><br />There's no getting away from Bobaj0r's dominance so far this season which in many respects is paralleling Sebastian Vettels same season. The McLaren driver starts at 8/11, but the surprise number two is Ferrari's Flouncy at 6/1 followed by Renault's Lambo of 8/1. TurrbalTerror's solid second at Valencia sees his odds strengthen to 9/1. Two time winner Ghost based on previous results is a fair bet at 12/1 as long as he tries to qualify.<br /><br /><b>Leggard Prediction</b><br />Race favourite Bobaj0r will most likely join the select club of Flouncy and Ghost to have won 3 consecutive races.</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>Silverstone marked a turning point in the Atomic F1 Season but it's unlikely it will tip the balance in this year's championship. McLaren's bobaj0r just has to hold everything together for the next 9 races to secure his first world championship. However any notion that the rest of the season will be dull affair couldn't be further from the truth. So we once again shake the magic eight ball and put our cards on the table. Who will master the German Grand Prix? <br /><br /><b>On Form:</b><br />While it would be right to once again mention McLaren's bobaj0r here, recently his team mate TurrbalTerror, has shown strong pace, and is knocking on the door for a victory. Showed strong pace in Silverstone and Valencia and the Nurburgring should play to his strengths and driving style. Has shown good qualifying pace, and a win just seems around the corner. It would seem that the only thing that could hold him back is from the other side of the garage. With the championship poised and the team wanting to ensure they secure the drivers championship, could we see team tactics play a part?<br /><br /><br /><b>Out Of Form:</b><br />Ferrari has been disappointingly quiet this few races. Some insiders say that they are already conceding the season to focus on pet races and next years car. Flouncy finished a very quiet 4th while his team mate BreakerMorant crossed the line 9th. But while the 50 point gap seems insurmountable, it only takes one or two good results, and some bad luck up the top and this could be a very different story. One team to watch.<br /><br /><b>One To Watch:</b><br />Williams continued there form resurgence with a well deserved podium at Silverstone. The Williams has looked strong in race trim for some time and the steady improvement has yielded two podiums this season so far. Exciting prospect for next season and could be in high demand when teams start finalising their driver line ups for season 5.<br /><br /><b>Talking Points:</b><br />The Championship:<br />We keep hearing that the championship is not over, but bobaj0r's current form and some basic maths appear to tell a different story. It's true that Renault is more competitive now than it has been at any other point this season, but bobaj0r needs some serious bad luck not to take this seasons world champion by this year's Brazilian Grand Prix. However, stranger things have happened in F1 and as proved in season 3, until it's mathematically impossible there is always a chance.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fast Facts:</b><br />This will be the 4th German Grand Prix, but the first at the Nurburgring. Past Winners - S1 Lambo, S2 HolyGhost, S3 HolyGhost.<br /><br /><b>Real Life Facts:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The original Nurburgring was built to help solve unemployment issues in the Eifel region following World War One. A workforce of approximately 25,000 constructed the 14.2 mile circuit at a cost of 14.1 million Reichsmarks.</li>
<li>The old circuit is now a toll road open to the public with a lap costing €24 a pop.</li>
<li>The first F1 race on the new circuit was held in 1984 and won by Alain Prost, but he was beaten by Ayrton Senna earlier that year in a race that pitted F1 drivers old and new against each other in identical Mercedes 190Es.</li>
<li>The circuit currently alternates with Hockenheim as the venue of the German Grand Prix.</li>
<li>The first German Grand Prix was held in 1926 at the Avus circuit in central Berlin.</li>
<li>Ferrari holds the record number of wins by a constructor at the German Grand Prix, with a total of 20. It is also the highest number of wins by a constructor at any grand prix.</li>
<li>An F1 car is on full throttle for 63% of an average lap at the Nurburgring.</li>
<li>Cars tend to make 67 gear changes per lap at the Nurburgring.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><b>Circuit:</b><br />Although the modern circuit pales in comparison to the original, the Nurburgring is still a decent race track in its own right. Modifications to the opening part of the lap in 2002 created an obvious overtaking opportunity and more exciting starts, and with the DRS zone on the long back straight into the NGK chicane - another passing spot - there should be plenty of action this weekend. The high-speed sector two requires a good balance but traction and stability under braking are also rewarded in sectors one and three. <br /><br /><b>Betting:</b><br />Bobaj0r is favourite to win in at even odds, ahead of Lambo at 4/1. TurrbalTerror is worth an each way bet at 5/1 and Williams Eradicator84 and Ferrari's Flouncy share 10/1 odds.<br /><br /><b>Leggard Prediction:</b><br />Looked strong before running out of fuel, and the inside scoop is that every setup and practice work has been going on the last few days in the McLaren garage. TurrbalTerror to take his first race win with second bobaj0r followed by Atomic Lambo to round out the podium.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[The grid has turned upside down and back-to-front for the Belgian Grand Prix.  Results may shock.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="~/media/28428/SPA_Francorchamps_track_by_arthobald_400x267.jpg"  width="400"  height="267" alt="Spa at night" style="float: right;"/>Some come for the waffles, some come for the beer, all come for Eu Rougue. Hosting the most infamous corner in F1, Spa Franchorchamp is also a tour de fource everywhere else. Set on hilly landscape, this the longest circuit on the calendar twists and turns at high speed as the cars go through numerous and dramatic elevation changes. </p>
<p>We also welcome back the F1 circus after a three week, tools down layoff, for the Christmas period.  Some drivers chose to do nothing, some went skiiing, some drove in other categories.  Some even left the series.</p>
<p>In big news ET Rom au has changed from Mercedes to Ferrari, joining Flouncy, in an attempt by the Scuderia to create a team that can challenge the deflating Mclaren squad.  Mercedes, after losing its last drive has poached Nightkid2 and Modz85 from Sauber.   Other big news is the likely mid-season retirement of championship leader and tour de fource bobaj0r, who has been silent for over a month.  It's possible he may return for this race but he may not be at full strength for the Mclaren team, leaving a lot of valuable points up for grabs from the other drivers.</p>
<p>In other big news, HolyGhost79 has had his internet connection upgraded and should now no longer want to start from the rear, meaning another of the big-guns has returned to the front, not that a back of the grid start ever prevented HolyGhost from scoring a podum finish or race win.</p>
<p>Had Mclaren continued to race Hungrary and practice through the offseason it would have been likely they'd have continued their domination of the podium, but now that seems unlikely at best.  Another quiet driver is Atomic Lambo and Renault, who typically does his talking only on the track. </p>
<p>This weekends race should see Flouncy take pole from HolyGhost79 and both battle it out for the top spot of the podium. Thrown into that mix should be Atomic Lambo who generally finishes either 2nd or 1st so can't be discounted.  A darkhorse is ET Rom, who under the tutelage of Flouncy should challenge for the bottom step of the podium if he can qualify well and keep his nose intact. </p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/28496/UFO Over Earth.JPG" width="242" height="320" alt="UFO Over Earth.JPG" style="float: right;"/>As some of you may have noticed at the beginning of the race last Sunday, Sora disappeared soon after race start. With spectators left confused and bewildered and the racing field left wondering as they got on with the race, we decided to do some digging.<br /><br />First we had to track down Soras car. We searched all over the pits but couldn't see any evidence of its where abouts. So, grasping at straws we decided to go to the media hall where all the live race footage comes in to look at the disappearance again. Reviewing the footage there wasn't much to make out other than a white flash of light and Sora was gone. With no other leads to follow up on we're out of ideas.<br /><br />Giving up we started watching the live race feeds coming in from around the track to see who was in the lead. Was about lap 4 and reports were saying rain was imminent. My camera man then noticed on one of the live feeds Sora being wheeled back into his garage! Quickly rewinding the feed we watched as we saw Soras car appear out of no where in a flash of light and come to a screeching halt in the pit box, with full wet tyres on. Strange we thought, so we both headed over to the Williams pits to see what was going on.<br /><br />Upon arrival and seeing the drenched car parked in the garage with worn full wet tyres, we asked one of the pit crew what on earth was going on.<br /><br />"Oh, well, the tech is still hush hush you see but we're not the first team to be running experimental temporal generators."<br /><br />"You talking about time travel!?"<br /><br />"Ssh! Look all I'll say is two things. First, you know that "nobody" fella over at Renault and "Modz" over in Mercedes? Yeah, go back a few races and see all the times when drivers thought they're racing them but they actually weren't, there's your evidence of them developing the same tech. Second, with this new tech obviously abusing a loophole in the current FIA 2011 rules we thought we'd cover our bases and start developing our own, just in case it starts providing better results this year and in the possible event this sort of thing gets ratified for the 2012 rules."<br /><br />"Obviously we've still some work to do in getting the circuits car tracking system to recognise each lap Sora did. But the fact he finished a whole GP in under 5 'our time' laps we've got a good foundation to build from. Who knows, maybe next race we'll win before the rest even starts! haha"<br /><br />So there you have it folks, seems we've uncovered the reason for all these oddities of late and possibly gotten a sneak peak at what the 2012 season holds.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[Lambo answers some random snippets of Trivia from the annals of atomicf1.  Who has competed in the least and most gps?  Has anyone won all races at one track? And more...]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><span class="postcolor"><strong>Q: Who has competed in the most Grand Prix races and who's driven in the least?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> It's no surprise to find out that the driver who's raced in the most grand prix's is no other than current Lotus-Renault driver Lambo who this weekend will start his 68th race. On the other end of the spectrum there are two drivers who share the honour of driving in just a single race. Notjedi and mm80x both have appeared in just one Atomic F1 event however those appearances are quite a distance apart. NotJedi's debut was in season four round 2 in Malaysia where he qualified 10th and finished a distant 14th. Mm80x's only appearance came at the Japanese grand prix in round 16 of season one. He qualified 8th but failed to finish the race.<br /><br /><strong>Q: The Hungarian GP of season 3 only had 5 starters. Is this a record for the least number of drivers for a GP?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> While five starters is the lowest number of participants in a championship round it's actually occurred on no less than four occasions. Rounds 18 and 19 of the opening season both had 5 runners, the lower than expected turn out was partly due to the fact the championship had been wrapped up by Lambo a few rounds before. The other two are the German Grand Prix of season two and as already mentioned the Hungarian GP of season three.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Lambo notched his third win at Spa out of four races there. Is that a record for a driver at one track?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> Lambo indeed did notch up his 17th career victory and his 3rd race win at Spa, however depending on how you look at, Ferrari's Flouncy also has won three times at Suzuka with the circuit still yet to be raced in season 4. If Flouncy is to win at Suzuka again this season it will be a record number of victories at a single track but more importantly it will mean that no other driver will have ever won at Suzuka.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Only six drivers have stood on the top podium in the history of Atomic F1. Which driver has come the closest to winning a race who's not in that top 6?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> The 6 drivers you are referring too are Flouncy, Lambo, Ghost, bobaj0r, TurrbalTerror, and finally Eradicator. Believe it or not a combination of these 6 have been on every single podium bar only 3 races in the history of Atomic F1. No driver that hasn't won a race has ever scored higher than a 3rd place which has occurred on three occasions. Season 2 round 16 at the Singapore GP saw Sora claim 3rd place with Modz doing the same in Season 3 round 11 and most recently ET ROM au placing 3rd in Melbourne in Season 4.</span></p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[We recently sat down with the erstwhile Williams driver and picked his brain.  Read the results here.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b><b>Q: You must get rid of a course that you raced so far in your AtomicF1 career - which do you choose, and why?</b><br />Bahrain easily. Boring and not that exciting. I was happy that Bahrain was removed for this season. A close second would be Valencia. It's just too long and easy to make mistakes in it.<br /><br /><b>Q: If you could choose a Atomic world champion as your team mate, who would you choose and why?</b><br />Lambo easily. Flouncy would deck my arse hard so having Lambo would be interesting to have as a team mate.<br /><br /><b>Q: What rules or innovations would you like to see in the future?</b><br />Bring back refuelling. Having to choose when to come in for fuel and tyres would be hard to beat.<br /><br /><b>Q: You can only drive at one circuit for the rest of your life - which AtomicF1 circuit, past or present from anywhere in the world, do you choose?</b><br />Singapore or Albert Park. I've had nice memories and those tracks are awesome to drive on.<br /><br /><b>Q: Force India, Virgin Racing, HRT and Scuderia Toro Rosso are just some of the teams that have departed the AtomicF1 championship. Which former team would you most liked to have raced with and why?</b><br />Virgin Racing. I've had some great memories when I was driving with them last season. It was a shame the team didn't get the founding and motivation to race in their last season before I moved over to Williams.<br /><br /><b>Q: You have to design a new F1 circuit, combining all your favourite corners from other tracks around the world. Which three corners are top of your list and why?</b><br />Eau Rouge at Spa, Massenet in Monaco and Epingle at Canada. All challenging corners that I love racing on.<br /><br /><b>Q: What current Formula One regulation would you most like to change and why?</b><br />Corner cutting if you fly off the track. I was slapped with too many drive-throughs this year!<br /><br /><b>Q: If you were a team boss, which current driver would you pick first for your team?</b><br />TurrbalTerror. He is quick and experienced. I wouldn't call him complete yet but he's getting there.<br /><br /><b>Q: You are given the chance to drive any legendary Formula One car of the past (excluding those made by your own team). Which car would you choose?</b><br />McLaren MP4-4. That thing dominated the sport and perhaps kickstarted the majority of the AtomicF1 dream.<br /><br /><b>Q:If you can add one thing to your car, what would it be?</b><br />A better ECU. It's giving me the shits. Plus, I'm guessing Ghost has been pissing in it so I'll fit a toilet for him.<br /><br /><b>Q:Which two drivers would be the Tom and Jerry of AtomicF1?</b><br />There is a Tom and Jerry racing?</p>]]></content>

              <content><![CDATA[<p>This weekend sees the atomicf1 circuis head to the Autodromo Nazionale Monza for the Italian Grand Prix.  the 4.250 km circuit is one of a decreasing number of classic European venues left on the Calendar and is notorious for it’s car mad fans, the tifosi.</p>
<p>Monza is another “Atomic Lambo” specialist circuit, where typically he likes to dominate, such as Monaco and Canada.  His record here isn’t so great though with an average finishing position of 3rd, although he has sat on pole for every race here.  The other drivers to have won here are Flouncy and the likely returning bobaj0r.  Looking at past results at this circuit atomicf1.com expects Atomic Lambo to again occupy pole position, and while SuperGrid™ suggests the Renault driver should enjoy a full second gap to second place, it’s expected that Flouncy should run him much closer for first place honours and if the current points leader returns, he too will likely challenge.  TurrbalTerror remains an unknown quantity at this circuit, having not raced here since season 1, he should also use his Mercedes powered car to challenge for a front row start.</p>
<p>Expect a few dramas as cars try and file through the tight turn one, Variante del Rettifilo, as previously this has been a place where collisions occurs. </p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[In this second installment Lambo answers some more snippets of Trivia from the annals of atomicf1.  Trivial and at the same time giving good insight into the who's who of atomic f1.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: Only 6 drivers combined have won all the races in the Atomic F1 Championship. How many manufacturers have won races?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> Ironically the answer to this question is also 6. In order of success the McLaren's currently hold the record with 20 wins, Force India a close second with 17 victories. GFI are only one win behind that with 16 victories, followed by Lotus with 5, Renault with 3 and Ferrari with 2 wins.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Ferrari's Flouncy has won a record 22 race victories with Force India, McLaren, GFI and Ferrari. Is this a record for a driver?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> It certainly is. Ferrari's Flouncy has won races driving for 4 separate manufacturers. Second place is Lambo who won his 17 races with either Force India or Renault. Of the remaining race winners, bobaj0r and TurrbalTerror all won their races driving for McLaren, while Ghost and Mark84 won theirs for Lotus and Williams respectively.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Who has won the most GPs in a single season without becoming world champion?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> This one's pretty straight forward. In easily the closest finish seen to date, season 3 came down to the last race in Abu Dhabi between the Lotus of Ghost and the McLaren of Flouncy. With only a handful of points separating them Flouncy would take the title securing his 8th win of the season. The same number as Ghost who would finish second in the proceedings due to his other points finishes.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Which drivers have finished second and third the most often in F1 races won by Flouncy?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> Of Flouncys 22 race victories, the clear leader in this department is Ghost who has finished on the podium below Flouncy on no less than 12 occasions. Second however is Lambo who has done the same in 10 races. Third place surprisingly belongs to Eradicator who's stood on the podium with flouncy 8 times while the rest are rounded out with TurrbalTerror with 6, and one a piece to Sora, ET ROM au and Modz.<br /><br /><strong>Q: How often has the podium in an Atomic F1 race been made up of Flouncy, Lambo and Ghost?</strong><br /><b>A:</b> I had to recheck this fact twice as the result was remarkable. Any combination of Flouncy, Lambo or Ghost standing on the podium in an Atomic F1 championship race has occurred on no less then 19 occasions. It happened just the once in season one, but an amazing 10 times in seasons 2 (including a remarkable run of 4 straight races between round 11 and 14), and 8 times in season 3. It's yet to happen in Season 4 however.</p>]]></content>

              <teaser><![CDATA[atomicf1 reviews the Next Level Racing Wheel Stand and gives it 10 screaming cylinders.]]></teaser>
              <content><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been on the lookout for a cockpit, to hopefully improve my times, but definitely improve my overall enjoyment.  I toyed with the idea of getting a model with an inbuilt seat but there’s both the high price and the size factor.  I’ve got an L shaped desk and I had just been clamping my G27 wheel and gear stick to that, with the carpet providing some resistance to nearly hold my pedals in place. </p>
<p>It doesn’t quite work though and often during a racing I’ll be trying to drag the pedals back to their optimal position, or worse yet, trying to very quickly reattach my steering wheel to the desk after I yanked it free in a hard bout of opposite lock.  I play a fair bit of games that use the H-shifter and I’d also like to have it in a more natural position, down lower near my leg, rather than on the same level as the wheel.</p>
<p><a href="/media/33074/Next Level Wheel Stand with G27.jpg"><img src="~/media/33074/Next Level Wheel Stand with G27_200x267.jpg"  width="200"  height="267" alt="Next Level Wheel Stand with G27.jpg" style="float: left;"/></a>My solution to this problem, given all the parameters, was the Next Level Racing Wheel, a sturdy frame that provides mounting points to screw in a G27 kit, wheel, pedals and shifters.</p>
<p>The package arrived via rather large cardboard box, almost fully assembled.  The out of the box experience was great and the frame was of high quality solid construction with an attractive pearl black enamel finish. </p>
<p>The only work on my part was fixing the gear shift lever on my preferred side (left) and then attaching the G27 components using the supplied allen key screws.  All hole lined up perfectly and all screws went in with minimum of fuss, a positive sign of a quality build process.  Another bonus, which I found thoughtful, was the inclusion of four velcro strips which I used to tuck the various cables of my G27 into the frame.  After about 15 minutes of assembly I was plugged in and doing laps in my favourite racing simulator.</p>
<p>The first few minutes of driving were spent adjusting the pedals, sliding them further back, and raising the height of the wheel, which also raises the height of the gearshift.  The wheel height extension arms have holes at regular intervals into which you can screw a bolt, but I found it possible to still have a sturdy setup with the screws firmly screwed in against the metal. </p>
<p>A few laps of hard driving later and I was impressed. The entire structure is solidly planted to the ground, a combination of the weight of the unit and rubber feet preventing movement on my carpet floored ‘study’.  I was also able to be very aggressive with all of the pedals, gearshift, and wheel without them moving; the hand screw adjustable pedal base remaining locked.</p>
<p>When I’m not playing racing games I simply unplug the USB cable from my PC and drag the frame off of the side. It also folds up vertically so it can be stored in a cupboard (or under a bed?), for those people who have their PC’s in a more open space or use it for a wheel on a console plugged in to their lounge room television.</p>
<p>Overall I give the unit 5/5 and I’ve got no complaints with what was supplied.  If I could do anything to improve the package it would be to provide a way to secure the wheels on my chair to the frame, at a positioning of my choosing.  This would ensure a perfect driving position. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p>

      <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Atomicf1.com is the home of the Atomic F1 racing league.  We, the most of us anyway, hail from www.atomicmpc.com.au but new league members from elsewhere are welcome.  You just need ot introduce yourself on the forums.</p>
<p>This site reports the happenings of the F1 2010 / F1 2011 competition run for <a href="http://www.atomicmpc.com.au">atomicmpc.com.au</a> members.  Content for the site is written based on events occurring within races held for this competition and the associated happenings occuring on the various threads for this competition, found at the atomicmpc.com.au <a href="http://forums.atomicmpc.com.au">forums</a>. I've continued the style of written originally started in these threads, treating this 'competition' as if it were real Formula 1, and writting about it from that perspective. </p>
<p>I've taken 'artistic liberty' with some of writings, to give it some more of the tension and drama that exists within real Formula 1, including the politics and other off track activity.  That 'artistic liberty' extends only to using adjectives and phrases that magnify the intensity of what's happening within this competition.</p>
<p>This site is for entertainment purposes and is intended to add another dimension to the 'Live the life' brand Codemasters use to market their F1 2010 game.</p>
<p>Various statistics are available based on the race results of rounds of the competition.  Results are capture via screenshots and FRAPS and are updated immediately after the conclusion of the day's racing (give or take 10 to 15 minutes).</p>
<p>This site also contains a number of guides for each circuit, as well as general guides on how to go faster.</p>
<p>Some basics about the competition:</p>
<ul class="style">
<li>Our competition is friendly and fierce</li>
<li>We only allow spring settings at a maximum of 8/8, until the 11/11 spring defect is fixed in Patch 2 of F1 2011</li>
<li>This is a competition for the PC version of F1 2011 only</li>
<li>Races are generally held every Sunday night at 8:00pm +11 GMT (Sydney, Australia time)</li>
<li>Races are 50% in the length</li>
<li>There is only one division.  When there are more than 16 drivers entering a particular race, we run pre-qualifying on a Thursday night, in which any new comers and the bottom half of the previous race will have to compete and register a race. Only the qualifying times count toward pre-qualification.  The fastest 8 drivers will qualify for the main race on Sunday.</li>
</ul>
